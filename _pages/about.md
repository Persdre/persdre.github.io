<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at National University of Singapore, advised by Prof. [Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/). 

At present, my research interest lies in **LLM Multi-Agent Systems and Trustworthy AI**. I believe LLMs should be developed and deployed in a way that benefits all of humanity, not just a privileged segment. In addition, I have a strong interest in quantitative trading and practical experience through Kaggle-based quantitative research projects.

As a typical ENTP, I’m positive, outgoing, and full of curiosity. If you have any questions or research topics you’d like to discuss, please feel free to contact me at persdre@gmail.com. <span style="color:#800020;">I am always open to collaborations. If you share similar interests or see potential synergies, please feel free to reach out via email!</span>

And I welcome connections and enjoy discussing a variety of topics, including (but not limited to) life choices, PhD applications, research, and personal relationships. I offer 30-minute chats, and we can converse in either English or Chinese. If you're interested, please send me an email with a few time slots that work for both of us, and we can schedule a time.
