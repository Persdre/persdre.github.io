<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at National University of Singapore, advised by Prof. [Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/). 

At present, my research interest lies in **LLM Multi-Agent Systems; LLM Reasoning/Evaluation/Safety and Cryptocurrency**. I believe LLMs should be developed and deployed in a way that benefits all of humanity, not just a privileged segment. I also have research experience in Graph Neural Networks and Deep Time Series Models. 

As a typical ENTP, I‚Äôm positive, outgoing, and full of curiosity. If you have any questions or research topics you‚Äôd like to discuss, please feel free to contact me at persdre@gmail.com or add me on WeChat (codemuse). <span style="color:#800020;">I am always open to collaborations. If you share similar interests or see potential synergies, please feel free to reach out via email!</span>
