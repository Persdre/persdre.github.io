Hello, talented young minds visiting my website! **I am recruiting undergraduate/graduate research interns to co-author publications for top conferences.** I have successfully led multiple papers that resulted in strong publications (one ICLR, one EMNLP, three papers are in submission). Your authorship position‚Äîeither first or second author‚Äîwill be determined by the level of your contribution. I will also provide guidance on how to write a good paper and prepare for applications to PhD programs. If interested, please reach out as soon as possible.

I am now a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at National University of Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/). I got my bachelor degree from National University of Singapore in 2022. Prior to that, I studied as an undergraduate at Zhiyuan Honors College, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, from 2017 to 2019. 

At present, my research interest lies in  **LLM Agents, LLM Interpretability, LLM Reasoning, and Cryptocurrency**. I also have research experience in Graph Neural Networks and Deep Time Series Models. If you have any questions or research topics you'd like to discuss, please feel free to contact me at persdre@gmail.com.
