<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at National University of Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/). I got my bachelor degree from National University of Singapore. Before that, I was an undergraduate from Zhiyuan College, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

At present, my research interest lies in  **LLM Agents and Cryptocurrency**. If you have any questions or research topics you'd like to discuss, please feel free to contact me at persdre@gmail.com.
