# The Submarine

Paul Graham's essay [The Submarine](http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html) argues that PR firms operate like a hidden force beneath mainstream news.

## The PR Industry's Reach

"More than half probably come from PR firms" of non-political mainstream news stories. Graham paid $16,000/month for PR services at Viaweb—they secured 60+ publications in 18 months.

## How PR Works

Good PR firms aren't typically dishonest. Instead, they provide "selective truths" that happen to favor their clients. True stories, chosen because they serve the client's interests.

## The "Buzz" Problem

PR firms deliberately feed identical stories to multiple publications simultaneously, creating artificial momentum. Graham demonstrates this by tracking repeated "suits are back" trend articles.

## Online's Advantage

Blog writing appears more authentic because authors write "what they think" rather than material influenced by PR pressure.

## My Takeaway

Practice "PR diving"—systematically identify trend stories by finding their common sources and client connections. Ask who benefits from what you're reading.
