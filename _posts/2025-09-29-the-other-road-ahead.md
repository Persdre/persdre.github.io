# The Other Road Ahead

Paul Graham's essay [The Other Road Ahead](http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html) argues that server-based software represents the next major computing paradigm.

## For Users

Web-based applications eliminate system administration burdens. Users need only "something with a keyboard, a screen, and a Web browser." Benefits include universal access, automatic updates, fewer bugs, and safer data storage.

## For Developers

Developers can employ any programming language since they control server infrastructure. Continuous deployment replaces traumatic annual release cycles. At Viaweb, they "often did three to five releases a day."

## For Startups

The barrier to entry becomes minimal. Web applications require no expensive development hardware or retail distribution—only inexpensive servers and a website.

## Microsoft's Vulnerability

Web-based software creates no automatic role for Microsoft. Since applications run server-side and users need only browsers, controlling the operating system becomes irrelevant.

## The Intensity Required

Web-based software development demands extreme commitment. The absence of traditional releases means the work never ends—"You can work 16-hour days for as long as you want to."

## My Takeaway

Build something users love, and make more than you spend. That's the essence of business. Written in 2001, this essay proved prophetic regarding cloud computing and SaaS.
