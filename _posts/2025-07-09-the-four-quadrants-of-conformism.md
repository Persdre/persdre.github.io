# The Four Quadrants of Conformism

Paul Graham's essay [The Four Quadrants of Conformism](http://www.paulgraham.com/conformism.html) proposes a two-axis classification system for people.

## The Four Types

1. **Aggressively Conventional-Minded**: "Crush <outgroup>!" - Tattletales who enforce rules on others

2. **Passively Conventional-Minded**: "What will the neighbors think?" - The largest group; follow rules but don't enforce

3. **Passively Independent-Minded**: "To each his own." - Dreamy types indifferent to rules

4. **Aggressively Independent-Minded**: "Eppur si muove." - The smallest group; questioners who resist authority

## Personality Over Context

"Which quadrant people fall into depends more on their own personality than the beliefs prevalent in their society."

## Why Independence Matters

Only independent-minded people generate genuinely novel ideas. "To be a successful scientist...it's not enough just to be right. You have to be right when everyone else is wrong."

## Danger of Idea Banning

Restrictions propagate unexpectedly. "Ideas are more closely related than they look."

## My Takeaway

Identify which quadrant you're in. If you want to do original work, you need to be in the independent-minded quadrants.
