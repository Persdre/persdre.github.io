# When to Do What You Love

Paul Graham's essay [When to Do What You Love](http://www.paulgraham.com/when.html) explores whether to pursue your passions professionally.

## The Core Tension

The question only matters "when you have to choose between working on what interests you the most and something else, like what pays the best."

## When Passion Aligns with Income

Unusual tastes—loving something both lucrative and unpopular—create optimal conditions. Bill Gates had "a genuine intellectual interest" in enterprise software.

## The Wealth Paradox

Those seeking modest income must often abandon passion for stability. But those pursuing extreme wealth benefit from genuine interests—many major startups began as passion projects.

## Overcoming Uncertainty

Try working on things you're interested in. "Stay upwind"—choose paths that preserve flexibility. Evaluate potential colleagues, since "you'll become like whoever you work with."

## The Great Work Requirement

"If you do want to do great work, the complicated question...becomes simple. The answer is yes."

## My Takeaway

Follow your passion if you want to do great work. Otherwise, the calculation is more nuanced.
