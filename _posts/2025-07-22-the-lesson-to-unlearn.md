# The Lesson to Unlearn

Paul Graham's essay [The Lesson to Unlearn](http://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html) argues that the most damaging lesson from school is learning to optimize for grades rather than genuine learning.

## The Grade-Learning Disconnect

Students prioritize grade performance over actual comprehension. "The measurement of what I was learning completely dominated actual learning in college."

## Tests Are Inherently Hackable

Schools create exploitable systems. Students learn that success means identifying test patterns—memorizing what professors emphasize rather than seeking deep understanding.

## The Broader Damage

This conditioning extends beyond school. Startup founders approach business like test-hacking: asking "how do we raise money?" instead of "how do we build great products?"

## Natural vs. Artificial Tests

Authority-imposed tests are hackable and artificial. Organic tests like market competition measure real performance and are inherently unhackable.

## Key Implication

As authority structures erode in modern work, the advantage shifts toward those doing genuinely good work over test-hackers.

## My Takeaway

Stop optimizing for arbitrary measurements. The market rewards real value, not credential-hacking.
