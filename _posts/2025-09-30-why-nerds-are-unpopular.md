# Why Nerds are Unpopular

Paul Graham's essay [Why Nerds are Unpopular](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html) explains that smart kids aren't unpopular because intelligence is despised—they simply have other things to think about.

## The Core Problem

Smart children prioritize intellectual pursuits over social climbing. If forced to choose, most nerds would trade thirty IQ points for being loved—but they won't actually make that trade.

## Popularity as Labor

Achieving social acceptance requires constant effort—comparable to professional specialization. Teenagers dedicate themselves entirely to popularity cultivation, while nerds remain distracted by other interests.

## Why Persecution Occurs

Bullying serves a social function: "nothing brings people closer than a common enemy." Groups bond by targeting outsiders.

## School as Artificial Environment

Schools create "a fake world" where teenagers are confined without meaningful purpose. This naturally degrades into savage hierarchies.

## The Real-World Difference

Adult society rewards competence and intelligence. When work has "real effects," nerds advantage themselves through correct answers.

## My Takeaway

The social dynamics of school are temporary. The real world rewards what you know and what you can build.
