# You Weren't Meant to Have a Boss

Paul Graham's essay [You Weren't Meant to Have a Boss](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html) argues that working for large organizations is fundamentally unnatural for humans.

## Organizational Structure Problem

Humans evolved to work in small groups (8-20 people). Large companies use hierarchical structures, but this means "each person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to the size of the entire tree."

## The Fake Tribe Effect

A 10-person team within a massive corporation has the right group size, but something essential is missing: individual autonomy. Corporate jobs are like junk food—"some of the qualities of things you're meant to like, but disastrously lacking in others."

## Impact on Programmers

Programming involves creating new things. Restrictive corporate environments are particularly damaging. Legacy code, bureaucracy, and interface restrictions prevent free exploration.

## The Transformation Effect

Startup founders arriving at Y Combinator often exhibit "the downtrodden air of refugees." Within months they become confident and energized.

## My Takeaway

"Working for oneself...is the natural way for programmers to live." Small companies offer significantly more freedom than large ones.
