# How to Be Silicon Valley

Paul Graham's essay [How to Be Silicon Valley](http://www.paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html) argues that Silicon Valley's success stems from people, not geography or infrastructure.

## The Core Thesis

Moving the right population elsewhere could replicate its success anywhere.

## Essential Requirements

Two groups are necessary: "rich people and nerds." These are the catalysts for startup formation. Buildings, government investment, and bureaucratic structures cannot substitute for this combination.

## Why Universities Matter

Top-tier universities act as magnets attracting talented individuals. A world-class computer science department draws researchers across thousands of miles.

## City Personality

Successful startup hubs require towns with distinctive character—preserved neighborhoods, independent businesses, and organic development.

## Demographics and Culture

- Young people drive startup formation
- Cities must maintain vibrant centers
- Tolerate unconventional ideas
- Offer pleasant living conditions

High-tech hubs tend to be politically liberal because they embrace odd concepts essential to innovation.

## Organic Growth

Startup ecosystems cannot be manufactured quickly. They develop through self-reinforcing cycles requiring years to mature.
