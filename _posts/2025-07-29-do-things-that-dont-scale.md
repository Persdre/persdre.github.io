# Do Things that Don't Scale

Paul Graham's essay [Do Things that Don't Scale](http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html) argues that startups succeed through deliberate, labor-intensive efforts in early stages.

## Manual User Recruitment

Founders must personally recruit early users. Stripe's "Collison installation" technique: directly set up customers on the spot. "If you have 100 users, you need to get 10 more next week to grow 10%."

## The Fragility Principle

Early startups are inherently fragile. Airbnb's door-to-door recruitment in New York—30 days of direct engagement made the difference between success and failure.

## Obsessive User Delight

Provide "insanely great" experiences through personal attention. Wufoo sent hand-written thank-you notes. Facebook customized course lists for each school.

## Narrow Initial Markets

Focus on a specific user segment first. Facebook began exclusively for Harvard students, creating a sense of belonging.

## What Doesn't Work

Big launches and partnerships rarely drive growth. Success depends on "how happy you made those users."

## My Takeaway

The unscalable work shapes company culture permanently. When founders prioritize user happiness during fragile early stages, this value persists.
