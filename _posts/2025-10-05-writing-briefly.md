# Writing, Briefly

Paul Graham's essay [Writing, Briefly](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html) argues that writing is undervalued because "writing doesn't just communicate ideas; it generates them."

## Writing Creates Ideas

Poor writers miss ideas that only emerge through the writing process itself. The act of writing is thinking.

## The Iterative Process

Start rough and fast, then rewrite repeatedly. Graham spent 23 minutes writing and 44 minutes rewriting this very essay.

## Practical Principles

- Cut ruthlessly and eliminate excess
- Adopt conversational language
- Expect 80% of ideas to emerge after starting
- Read work aloud to identify awkward phrasing
- Use simple vocabulary
- Publish online to maintain motivation through audience awareness

## My Takeaway

First drafts are stepping stones, not failures. The real work happens in revision. Write to think, then rewrite to communicate.
