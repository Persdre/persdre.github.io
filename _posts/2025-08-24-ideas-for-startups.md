# Ideas for Startups

Paul Graham's essay [Ideas for Startups](http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html) argues that generating startup ideas is far easier than people believe.

## Ideas Are Overvalued

People mistakenly treat startup concepts as "million dollar ideas" that must be brilliant. In reality, "startup ideas are worthless" in market terms—nobody buys them. Value emerges through implementation.

## Ideas as Questions

Frame concepts as explorations: "Could we create X?" This removes psychological barriers and allows flexibility. The initial idea typically evolves completely through building.

## Two Essential Requirements

1. **Exposure to emerging technologies** (the "ingredients")
2. **Conversations with the right people** (the "kitchen")

Universities excel because they combine both naturally.

## The Problem-First Approach

Successful ideas emerge from identifying genuine problems. Finding something "intolerable" and "feeling it must be possible to solve" drives innovation.

## The Accidental Route

Many major startups (Apple, Yahoo, Lotus) began unintentionally—built for personal use rather than as commercial ventures.

## My Takeaway

The best startup ideas emerge from hackers building interesting projects with friends, not from deliberate brainstorming sessions.
