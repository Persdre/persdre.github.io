# Stuff

Paul Graham's essay [Stuff](http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html) argues that in modern societies, material possessions have become a burden rather than a treasure.

## Historical Perspective

"Stuff used to be rare and valuable." Old houses lack closets because people owned fewer possessions. Photos from the 1970s show remarkably empty homes.

## The Value Misconception

People wrongly calculate value as the difference between retail and purchase price. "The value of some new acquisition wasn't the difference between its retail price and what I paid for it. It was the value I derived from it."

## Psychological Burden

Accumulated possessions become tyrannical. A cluttered environment is "literally exhausting" because human brains must constantly parse their surroundings. Possessions can trap people—unable to retire because their stuff demands a larger house.

## Practical Solutions

Ask: "Will I use this constantly?" before purchasing. Graham exempts books as fundamentally different—more like fluid knowledge.

## My Takeaway

For most people today, stuff represents a net burden rather than an asset. Own less.
