# Succinctness is Power

Paul Graham's essay [Succinctness is Power](http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html) argues that succinctness in programming languages directly correlates with power.

## The Core Hypothesis

"Succinctness = power" or close enough to be treated as identical. High-level languages exist primarily to reduce code size compared to machine language.

## Measuring Succinctness

Rather than lines of code, measure program size by "elements"—distinct nodes in a syntax tree representing source code. This quantifies conceptual load.

## Language Design Implications

Discovering ways to make diverse programs shorter likely indicates genuine abstractions worth pursuing. More succinct languages enable programmers to solve larger problems within their cognitive capacity.

## Evidence

Fred Brooks observed that programmers produce roughly equivalent code volumes daily across languages. Language succinctness is the primary productivity differentiator.

## Readability vs. Succinctness

While individual verbose lines may appear readable, "Total effort = effort per line × number of lines." Succinctness reduces total comprehension burden.

## My Takeaway

When languages feel restrictive, it often reflects insufficient succinctness—you cannot express solutions as compactly as conceived.
