# What Doesn't Seem Like Work?

Paul Graham's essay [What Doesn't Seem Like Work?](http://www.paulgraham.com/work.html) argues that activities which feel effortless to you—but arduous to others—indicate your natural talents.

## The Core Heuristic

"If something that seems like work to other people doesn't seem like work to you, that's something you're well suited for."

## Evidence Through Examples

Many programmers enjoy debugging despite its tedious reputation—suggesting this affinity may be prerequisite for the field. Writing papers for classmates felt engaging rather than obligatory.

## Diagnostic Value

Unusual preferences contain meaningful information about vocation. The stranger your tastes appear to peers, the stronger the signal about appropriate work direction.

## Finding Your Path

Rather than relying on explicit career guidance, become a detective of your own preferences. Use counterintuitive enjoyment as a compass.

## My Takeaway

Examine tasks others find burdensome but you find easy. That asymmetry points to where you should focus your career.
