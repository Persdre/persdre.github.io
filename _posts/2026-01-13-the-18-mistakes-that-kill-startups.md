# The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups

Paul Graham's essay [The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html) identifies common pitfalls, organized around a central principle: "if you make something users want, you'll probably be fine."

## Team & Leadership Issues

- **Single Founder**: Lack of collaborators for brainstorming and emotional support creates vulnerability
- **Fights Between Founders**: Often stems from poor initial partner selection
- **Half-Hearted Effort**: Most failures result from founders maintaining day jobs

## Product Development

- **Marginal Niche**: Selecting obscure markets to avoid competition prevents building genuinely valuable products
- **Derivative Ideas**: Copying existing companies rarely succeeds
- **Obstinacy**: Excessive attachment to original plans prevents adaptation
- **No Specific User in Mind**: Vague audiences doom products
- **Slowness in Launching**: Perfectionism delays critical user feedback
- **Launching Too Early**: Premature releases damage reputation

## Resources & Money

- **Bad Location**: Geographic concentration in tech hubs creates measurable advantages
- **Hiring Bad Programmers**: Non-technical founders struggle identifying quality engineers
- **Raising Too Little**: Insufficient runway prevents reaching milestones
- **Raising Too Much**: Creates pressure, bloat, and reduced flexibility
- **Spending Too Much**: Excessive hiring increases costs and slows progress

## Execution Problems

- **Sacrificing Users for Profit**: Premature monetization overshadows building demand
- **Not Getting Hands Dirty**: Avoiding business development misses user acquisition
- **Poor Investor Management**: Either ignoring or surrendering control to investors

## The Fundamental Truth

The ultimate cause of failure is "not making something users want." Most failures trace to insufficient effort rather than circumstances.
