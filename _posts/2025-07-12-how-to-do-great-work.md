# How to Do Great Work

Paul Graham's essay [How to Do Great Work](http://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html) identifies four universal steps across all fields.

## The Four Steps

1. **Choose a field** matching your natural aptitude and deep interest
2. **Learn enough to reach the frontier** of current knowledge
3. **Notice the gaps** others overlook
4. **Explore promising gaps** boldly

## On Finding Your Work

"You can't tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them." Experiment broadly, optimize for interestingness, follow genuine curiosity over prestige.

## On Curiosity

Seek what you're "excessively curious about — curious to a degree that would bore most other people."

## On Execution

- Consistency matters more than intensity
- Embrace "staying upwind"—preserving flexibility rather than rigid planning
- Expect diminishing returns; deep work yields only 4-5 productive hours daily

## On Risk and Youth

Young people should take proportionate risks since they can afford setbacks better.

## My Takeaway

New ideas seem simultaneously obvious and revolutionary after discovery. They emerge from noticing where existing models break down.
