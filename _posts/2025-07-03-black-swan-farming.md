# Black Swan Farming

Paul Graham's essay [Black Swan Farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html) argues that startup investing is counterintuitive because success follows a "black swan" distribution.

## Concentration of Returns

"Just two companies, Dropbox and Airbnb, account for about three quarters" of Y Combinator's ~$10 billion in funded company value. 1000x variation in outcomes defies normal expectations.

## The Paradox of Good Ideas

The best startup ideas initially appear terrible. "If a good idea were obviously good, someone else would already have done it." The sweet spot sits at the intersection of "seems like a bad idea" AND "is actually good."

## Measuring Success Is Misleading

Fundraising success after Demo Day is negatively correlated with actual returns. This metric is "positively misleading" because it encourages conservatism.

## Central Tension

Y Combinator should theoretically fund startups where only 30% raise follow-on funding. But even knowing this, they cannot psychologically accept it.

## My Takeaway

Knowing what's intellectually right doesn't guarantee doing it. The best opportunities look wrong at first.
