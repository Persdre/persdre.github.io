# Crazy New Ideas

Paul Graham's essay [Crazy New Ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/newideas.html) argues that dismissing implausible-sounding ideas from competent domain experts is both risky and foolish.

## Why These Ideas Matter

When reasonable experts propose seemingly crazy ideas, their implausibility becomes a positive signal. They must understand something you don't, or they wouldn't propose something "so wrong."

"If the person proposing the idea is reasonable, then they know how implausible it sounds."

## Expected Value

These ideas need not succeed to be worth pursuing—they simply require sufficient probability of success relative to potential impact. Betting on the full portfolio of expert-proposed "crazy" ideas yields positive returns overall.

## Why People Dismiss Them

Several culprits:
- Envy
- The ease of attacking nascent ideas
- Vested interests in existing paradigms
- The pervasive grip of current paradigms on our thinking

Paradigms form "the Lego blocks we build thoughts out of."

## Historical Blindness

Current paradigms obscure their own history. Copernicus's heliocentric model took over a century to gain scientific acceptance, yet this history remains largely forgotten.

## Practical Wisdom

Rather than dismissing such ideas, ask questions to understand the expert's reasoning. Support these lonely truth-seekers—you'll learn something valuable either way.
