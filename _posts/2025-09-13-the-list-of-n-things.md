# The List of N Things

Paul Graham's essay [The List of N Things](http://www.paulgraham.com/nthings.html) explains why the "7 Things..." format is popular—and what's wrong with it.

## Why Readers Prefer Lists

- Structure is explicit, eliminating mental work
- "Random access"—readers can skip sections without losing comprehension
- Points are independent, making the format "fault tolerant"

## Advantages for Writers

The format protects against incomplete thinking, allows quick scaffolding, and eliminates the risk of "running out of ideas" mid-argument.

## The Critical Weakness

"There's so little room for new thought." Since writers determine the title first, discoveries during composition remain confined to predetermined categories. This constrains genuine intellectual exploration.

## On Education

The five-paragraph essay is actually a disguised list of n things. Making this explicit would be more honest than obscuring the format with artificial transitions.

## My Takeaway

The format's accessibility represents both democratization and intellectual limitation. Recognize when you're using constrained thinking structures.
