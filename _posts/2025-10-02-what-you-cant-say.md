# What You Can't Say

Paul Graham's essay [What You Can't Say](http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html) argues that every era contains invisible moral fashions—arbitrary social taboos mistaken for universal truths.

## The Conformist Test

If your beliefs perfectly align with accepted views, this likely reflects social pressure rather than independent thought. Challenge yourself to identify opinions you'd hesitate expressing publicly.

## Methods for Identifying Taboos

**Observe trouble**: "The statements that make people maddest are those they worry might be true."

**Examine labels**: Watch for dismissive terms like "divisive" or "inappropriate" that shut down debate.

**Study history**: Compare past and present moral standards to spot arbitrary shifts.

**Analyze power dynamics**: Taboos emerge when groups have "power but nervousness."

## Practical Guidance

Maintain internal intellectual freedom while strategically choosing battles. Think freely privately, but manage public expression carefully.

## Why This Matters

Recognizing unthinkable ideas enables genuine innovation. Sciences advance precisely because researchers question assumptions others won't examine.

## My Takeaway

A brain that can go anywhere produces breakthrough thinking. Separate your thinking from your speaking—but never stop thinking.
