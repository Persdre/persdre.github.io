# Write Simply

Paul Graham's essay [Write Simply](http://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html) advocates for plain, straightforward prose as superior to ornate or complex writing.

## The Benefits

**Reader Engagement**: Simple writing reduces friction. "The less energy they expend on your prose, the more they'll have left for your ideas."

**Accessibility**: Non-native English speakers may understand sophisticated concepts but struggle with difficult vocabulary. Simple language bridges this gap.

**Longevity**: Clear writing withstands temporal and cultural changes better than trendy or complicated prose, much like well-crafted furniture.

**Honesty**: Fancy writing can mask weak thinking. "Writing simply keeps you honest." Shallow ideas become immediately apparent.

**Consideration**: Intentionally complex writing forces readers into unnecessary labor, making it inconsiderate rather than impressive.

## On Obscurity

Graham distinguishes between intentional complexity for effect versus accidental clumsiness. Overly complicated sentences are failures, not achievements.

## His Process

Draft quickly, then spend days editing—cutting ruthlessly. This approach naturally produces simpler, more refined prose.

## My Takeaway

Simplicity isn't dumbing down. It's the result of understanding something deeply enough to explain it clearly. Complexity often hides confusion.
