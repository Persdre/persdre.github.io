# The Top of My Todo List

Paul Graham's essay [The Top of My Todo List](http://www.paulgraham.com/todo.html) addresses how to avoid life's biggest regrets.

## The Regrets Framework

Graham distills dying patients' regrets into one principle: "don't be a cog." People unconsciously shrink themselves to fit circumstances and operate mechanically.

## The Danger of Omission

Major life mistakes are typically "errors of omission"—things left undone rather than actively done wrong. These happen "by default," making them insidious.

## The Solution: Inverted Reminders

Graham inverts the five regrets into five affirmative commands:

> "Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy."

These statements serve as his todo list header.

## My Takeaway

Intentional, recurring reminders are necessary counterweights to our default patterns of negligence in matters most essential to meaningful life.
