# Copy What You Like

Paul Graham's essay [Copy What You Like](http://www.paulgraham.com/copy.html) argues that developing genuine aesthetic judgment requires distinguishing between what you truly enjoy and what you admire based on external validation.

## Graham's Personal Mistakes

He describes three formative periods where he imitated the wrong models:
- In high school, he copied depressing short stories because they seemed prestigious
- In college, he mimicked philosophy papers that "weren't really saying anything"
- In graduate school, he wasted effort on fashionable but empty expert systems technology

## The Core Principle

"Copy only what you genuinely like." His fundamental error was believing things were good "because they were admired" rather than because he found authentic value in them.

## Practical Methods

**Ignore presentation**: Imagine how much you'd pay for something at a garage sale to reveal honest preferences.

**Examine guilty pleasures**: These represent "pure" enjoyment uncomplicated by the desire to appear cultured.

## Avoiding Imitation Pitfalls

When copying admirable work, focus on what makes it excellent rather than its surface flaws. Eighteenth-century painters mimicked Renaissance masters' brownish tones, not realizing they were copying accumulated dirt.

## The Central Lesson

"You have to figure out for yourself what's good. You can't trust authorities."
