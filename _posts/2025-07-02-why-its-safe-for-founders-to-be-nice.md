# Why It's Safe for Founders to Be Nice

Paul Graham's essay [Why It's Safe for Founders to Be Nice](http://www.paulgraham.com/safe.html) argues that founders can afford to be ethical because growth rate compounds while ruthlessness doesn't.

## The Growth Rate Advantage

Even if a "nice" founder extracts only half the revenue from users compared to a ruthless counterpart, they catch up quickly. If niceness enables even slightly better growth (6% vs 5%), the nice founder pulls ahead significantly within two years.

## Different Rules for Startups

Unlike traditional businesses, startups typically win through "making something so great that people recommend it to their friends." Rapacity actively harms viral growth.

## What Actually Drives Successful Founders

Contrary to popular belief, successful founders aren't motivated primarily by money. If they were, they'd accept acquisition offers. Instead, "the company is their project."

## The Deal

Optimize for growth rate while maintaining integrity. This tradeoff makes you both happier and more successful.

## My Takeaway

Nice founders win because growth rate matters more than extraction rate.
