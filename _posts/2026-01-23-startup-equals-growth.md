# Startup = Growth

Paul Graham's essay [Startup = Growth](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html) provides the clearest definition of what a startup actually is: a company designed to grow fast.

## The Definition

Being newly founded or working in technology is irrelevant. Growth is the defining characteristic. This distinguishes startups from ordinary businesses like barbershops or restaurants.

A restaurant in one location can be great, but it's not a startup. A restaurant concept that can be replicated rapidly across hundreds of locations might be.

## Scalability Requirements

For rapid growth, companies need two things:
1. **Creating something many people want**
2. **Reaching those people efficiently**

Technology typically enables the second by overcoming distribution constraints that limit traditional businesses.

## Measuring Success

Growth rate—not absolute customer numbers—matters most. Graham recommends measuring weekly growth as a percentage:
- **Healthy during YC**: 5-7% weekly
- **Exceptional**: 10% weekly

This metric becomes a compass for decision-making: "anything that gets you the growth you need is right."

## The Power of Compounding

Small growth rate differences create dramatically different outcomes:
- **5% weekly growth** → 12.6x larger annually
- **1% weekly growth** → 1.7x larger annually

This explains why startups attract venture capital despite high failure rates. The winners win big.

## Three Growth Phases

Successful startups typically experience:
1. Slow initial growth (finding product-market fit)
2. Rapid expansion (scaling what works)
3. Deceleration as market limits approach

This forms an S-curve pattern.

## My Takeaway

The growth lens is clarifying. It forces you to ask: can this scale? If the answer is no, you might be building a great business, but not a startup. Both are valid—just don't confuse them.
