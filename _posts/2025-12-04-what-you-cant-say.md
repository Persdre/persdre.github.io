# What You Can't Say

Paul Graham's essay [What You Can't Say](http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html) argues that moral taboos function like invisible fashions—arbitrary yet enforced with serious consequences.

## The Conformist Test

If you never disagree with prevailing opinion, you're probably just conforming rather than thinking independently. Graham compares this to mapmakers deliberately inserting errors: if your beliefs perfectly match society's approved positions, that's suspiciously coincidental.

## Methods for Identifying Taboos

1. **Observe reactions to troubling statements** — Ideas that provoke anger rather than refutation likely contain uncomfortable truths

2. **Track weaponized labels** — Terms like "inappropriate," "divisive," or "defeatist" signal suppressed ideas worth examining

3. **Compare across time and cultures** — Ideas considered harmless historically or elsewhere but taboo here warrant scrutiny

4. **Study the overly fastidious** — Institutions known for rigidity concentrate current taboos

5. **Understand taboo mechanics** — Powerful but nervous groups create taboos to suppress threatening ideas

## Strategic Recommendations

- Think freely privately but choose carefully what to express publicly
- Use abstraction, metaphor, and humor to challenge taboos indirectly
- Avoid pointless battles that distract from meaningful work

## My Takeaway

Developing the ability to question taboos strengthens intellectual capability, prevents belief in future-ridiculous ideas, and enables genuine innovation.
