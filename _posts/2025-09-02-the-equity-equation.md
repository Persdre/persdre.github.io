# The Equity Equation

Paul Graham's essay [The Equity Equation](http://www.paulgraham.com/equity.html) presents a mathematical framework for evaluating equity trades: **1/(1 - n)**.

## The Basic Principle

"You should give up n% of your company if what you trade it for improves your average outcome enough that the (100 - n)% you have left is worth more than the whole company was before."

## Investor Example

Trading 50% of your company requires doubling the company's value to break even. For Y Combinator's typical 7% stake, the startup needs improvement of 7.5% or more.

## Top VC Advantage

Sequoia's practice of taking ~30% equity (requiring 43% improvement) represents an exceptional deal because their brand value alone dramatically increases startup prospects.

## Employee Stock Grants

An employee who increases company value by 20% deserves stock calculated as **(i - 1)/i**, yielding 16.7%.

## My Takeaway

Always ensure equity trades leave you feeling financially richer. If the math doesn't work, reconsider the deal.
