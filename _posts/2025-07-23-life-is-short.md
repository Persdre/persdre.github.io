# Life is Short

Paul Graham's essay [Life is Short](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html) argues that life is genuinely short, not merely a figure of speech.

## Life's Actual Brevity

"If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited." Convert abstract time into discrete quantities—only 52 weekends with a 2-year-old.

## Eliminating Bullshit

The primary waste of life is "bullshit"—unnecessary meetings, bureaucracy, posturing, pointless disputes. Distinguish between forced bullshit (unavoidable) and chosen bullshit (addictive distractions).

## Recognizing What Matters

"Having coffee with a friend matters. You won't feel later like that was a waste of time." Meaningful activities often lack prestige but provide lasting satisfaction.

## Urgency and Action

Don't delay meaningful experiences. Windows close permanently—through death or changed circumstances.

## Primary Recommendations

- Relentlessly eliminate time-wasting activities
- Actively pursue meaningful pursuits
- Savor present moments with full attention
- Act immediately on important goals

## My Takeaway

Life is short. Cut the bullshit. Do what matters.
