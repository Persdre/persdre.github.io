# After Credentials

Paul Graham's essay [After Credentials](http://www.paulgraham.com/credentials.html) argues that society is transitioning from judging people by credentials to evaluating them based on actual performance.

## Historical Context

Graham traces credential systems back to 587 China. While progressive for its time, credentials create a self-perpetuating cycle favoring the wealthy who can afford test preparation.

## The Problem

Credentials function as predictive tools where performance measurement is difficult. But they "leak"—converting parental wealth into credentials across generations.

## The Shift

The U.S. economy changed in the late 1970s-1980s:
- Startups emerged as viable alternatives
- Companies paid market rates for performance
- The "yuppie" phenomenon showed youth could succeed through direct evaluation

## Market as Solution

Smaller organizations in competitive markets "keep just the good ones" through performance, eliminating credential gatekeeping.

## My Takeaway

Performance measurement through market competition proves more effective than credentials at rewarding genuine capability.
