# How to Start Google

Paul Graham's essay [How to Start Google](http://www.paulgraham.com/google.html) offers practical advice for young people interested in eventually launching a startup.

## Three Essential Requirements

**1. Technology Proficiency**

Develop genuine skill in some technology field through personal projects, not just classroom learning. "You can graduate with a degree in computer science from a top university and still not be any good at programming."

Programming is recommended, though anything involving making or building counts—from welding to video production.

**2. Startup Ideas**

Strong ideas emerge naturally when you're technologically skilled and observe the world's problems. Mark Zuckerberg saw Facebook's need at Harvard. Larry Page and Sergey Brin recognized search's limitations.

The best approach involves "building things for yourself and your friends to use" rather than chasing abstract market opportunities.

**3. Cofounders**

Find collaborators through working together on projects. Attend selective universities not for prestige but because they concentrate smart, motivated people—the ideal cofounder pool.

## The Project-Centric Approach

Personal projects are the ultimate learning tool and idea generator. Apple, Google, and Facebook started as passion projects, not calculated business plans.
