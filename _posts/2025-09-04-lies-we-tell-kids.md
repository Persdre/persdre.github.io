# Lies We Tell Kids

Paul Graham's essay [Lies We Tell Kids](http://www.paulgraham.com/lies.html) argues that adults systematically mislead children, often with good intentions.

## The Conspiracy of Silence

Adults collectively agree on topics requiring "ask your parents" responses—religion, sex, death. This creates an almost seamless false reality.

## Protection vs. Prolonged Deception

While shielding young children from frightening realities has merit, extending this too long creates problems. Suburban childhoods become "suffocatingly fake" by adolescence.

## The School Lie

The biggest lie: "success comes through following the rules." Textbooks represent compromises between powerful groups' interests.

## The Peace Motive

Often the most powerful reason for lying: children lack self-control and react emotionally, so parents lie to maintain household peace.

## Truth Debt

Graham compares unexamined lies to "oxygen debt" in athletics. Adults accumulate lies affecting their worldviews and priorities. Most never consciously untangle these falsehoods.

## My Takeaway

Adults must consciously identify and challenge lies they absorbed. You're "far from a neutral observer" and must "consciously erase" internalized deceptions.
