# How to Disagree

Paul Graham's essay [How to Disagree](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html) establishes a hierarchy for online discourse.

## The Disagreement Hierarchy

**DH0 (Name-calling)**: The lowest form, including both crude insults and articulate personal attacks

**DH1 (Ad Hominem)**: Attacking the arguer rather than the argument

**DH2 (Tone)**: Criticizing writing style instead of substance

**DH3 (Contradiction)**: Simply stating the opposing view without evidence

**DH4 (Counterargument)**: Providing reasoning and evidence against a position

**DH5 (Refutation)**: Using direct quotes to identify and explain errors

**DH6 (Central Point Refutation)**: The strongest form—attacking core arguments with a passage you feel is mistaken

## Core Insights

- Lower-level disagreements are always unconvincing
- Most dishonest arguments stem from unintentional reasoning
- Disagreeing well actually makes people happier

## My Takeaway

As online discourse increases, learn to disagree effectively. Aim for DH5 and DH6—refute the central point with evidence.
