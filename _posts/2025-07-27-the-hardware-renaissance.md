# The Hardware Renaissance

Paul Graham's essay [The Hardware Renaissance](http://www.paulgraham.com/hw.html) argues that hardware startups are experiencing a resurgence.

## Empirical Evidence

In Y Combinator's batch from October 2012, 7 out of 84 companies focused on hardware, and "on the whole they've done better than the companies that weren't."

## Investor Bias is Outdated

"Investors' opinions are a trailing indicator. The best founders are better at seeing the future than the best investors."

## Technology Enablers

- Crowdfunding success (Kickstarter)
- Tablet proliferation enabling new applications
- Improved electric motors and wireless connectivity
- Accessible prototyping tools (Arduinos, 3D printers)
- Online retail reducing distribution barriers

## Historical Context

Software's advantage "only dates from about 1990" and "may not be permanent." Physical products possess inherent appeal: "Hackers love to build hardware, and customers love to buy it."

## My Takeaway

Don't fear investor skepticism about hardware. The best founders see the future before investors do.
