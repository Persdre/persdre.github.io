# What You'll Wish You'd Known

Paul Graham's essay [What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html) offers advice for high school students on navigating adolescence.

## Don't Rush Career Decisions

High school students needn't know their life's direction yet. "Discover what you like" and work toward fields where you can excel.

## Stay Upwind

Work forward from promising situations rather than backward from distant goals. Choosing fields like math over economics preserves flexibility since math skills transfer broadly.

## Seek Hard Problems

"Look for smart people and hard problems." Real work involves worry and suspense. If you're not concerned about potential failure, the challenge isn't difficult enough.

## Treat High School as a Day Job

Treat school as employment done at 3 p.m., allowing time for genuine personal projects.

## Discipline Isn't the Foundation

Great achievers lack heavy self-discipline. Genuine interest sustains them. They're "terrible procrastinators" who work because they feel "ill" without it.

## My Takeaway

"There's no switch inside you that magically flips when you turn a certain age." True adulthood begins when you decide to get things done, regardless of age.
