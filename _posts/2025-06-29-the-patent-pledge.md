# The Patent Pledge

Paul Graham's essay [The Patent Pledge](http://www.paulgraham.com/patentpledge.html) proposes a voluntary pledge for tech companies to refrain from using patents against small startups.

## The Problem

Graham distinguishes between patent reform (slow, requires government) and preventing harmful patent *use*. He focuses on established companies weaponizing patents against innovative competitors.

## The Solution

"No first use of software patents against companies with less than 25 people."

## Why This Works

- Companies that adopt it signal higher ethical standards
- Holdout companies become conspicuous
- Requires "no change in behavior" for ethical tech companies
- Modeled after "Don't be evil"—deliberately vague to encourage common sense

## Scope & Limitations

Targets a specific abuse: established firms suppressing innovation. Won't address patent trolls, but tackles a "more serious" problem—companies "attacking innovation at the root."

## My Takeaway

Market pressure can address problems without legislative battles. Push your employer to adopt ethical pledges.
