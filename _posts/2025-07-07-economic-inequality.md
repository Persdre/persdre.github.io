# Economic Inequality

Paul Graham's essay [Economic Inequality](http://www.paulgraham.com/ineq.html) argues that economic inequality is not a single problem but has multiple causes—some bad, some good.

## The Pie Fallacy

Rich people don't only become wealthy by taking from the poor. Wealth can be created. "A woodworker creates wealth. He makes a chair, and you willingly give him money in return."

## Multiple Sources

Rather than one cause, inequality stems from various sources. "To understand economic inequality...you have to go find individual people who are poor or rich and figure out why."

## Technology's Role

Accelerating technological productivity is an "irreducible core" of inequality with "immense momentum." This cannot be reversed without eliminating entrepreneurship.

## Recommended Focus

Instead of targeting inequality itself, address:
- Actual poverty (not relative inequality)
- Blocked social mobility
- Corrupt practices
- Systemic injustices

## My Takeaway

"Economic inequality is sufficiently far from identical with the various problems" that focusing on it misses underlying issues requiring direct attention.
