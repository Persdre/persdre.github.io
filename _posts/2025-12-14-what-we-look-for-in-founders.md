# What We Look for in Founders

Paul Graham's essay [What We Look for in Founders](http://www.paulgraham.com/founders.html) identifies five essential qualities Y Combinator seeks.

## The Five Qualities

**1. Determination**

The most crucial trait. Founders need resilience to overcome inevitable obstacles. Persistence makes founders unstoppable partners.

**2. Flexibility**

Equally important as determination. "You need to be able to modify your dreams on the fly." Pivot through multiple ideas before finding success.

**3. Imagination**

The form of intelligence that matters most involves generating unconventional ideas. "Most good ideas seem bad initially." Airbnb represents this perfectly—a concept that seemed implausible, yet succeeded spectacularly.

**4. Naughtiness**

Successful founders possess a "piratical gleam" and delight in circumventing rules, though not the important ones. They prioritize results over propriety.

**5. Friendship**

Strong founder relationships prove essential. Startups strain partnerships severely, so founders must genuinely like and understand each other.

## The Balance

Determination and flexibility seem contradictory, but both are essential. Be determined about the destination, flexible about the route.

## My Takeaway

These qualities can be developed. Work on your determination, stay flexible, cultivate imagination, maintain your piratical spirit, and choose your cofounders wisely.
