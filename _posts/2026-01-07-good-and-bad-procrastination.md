# Good and Bad Procrastination

Paul Graham's essay [Good and Bad Procrastination](http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html) argues that procrastination isn't inherently harmful—it depends on what you're avoiding.

## Three Types

Procrastination varies based on what replaces work:
1. Doing nothing
2. Working on less important tasks
3. Tackling more important ones

**"Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work."** The most accomplished people practice the third type, deferring mundane tasks to focus on significant projects.

## Why Small Tasks Destroy Productivity

Errands—work with "zero chance of being mentioned in your obituary"—are deceptively dangerous. They fragment attention and interrupt deep work.

Interruptions don't just consume time: "The cost of an interruption is not just the time it takes, but that it breaks the time on either side in half."

## The Hidden Threat

The real problem is unconscious procrastination disguised as productivity. People convince themselves they're accomplishing things while avoiding their most important work through emails, cleaning, and errands.

## Overcoming Procrastination

Ask Hamming's famous questions:
- What are the most important problems in your field?
- Are you working on one of them?
- Why not?

Work on ambitious projects you genuinely enjoy. Let "delight" pull you toward meaningful work rather than relying on guilt-driven scheduling.

## My Takeaway

Procrastination isn't the enemy. Procrastinating on the wrong things is. Deliberately procrastinate on errands to protect time for work that matters.
