# Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Ideas

Paul Graham's essay [Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/ambitious.html) argues that the most ambitious startup ideas are psychologically repellent, not attractive.

## Why Big Ideas Frighten Us

Large startup concepts trigger self-doubt. "The biggest startup ideas are terrifying" because they "threaten your identity." This psychological barrier filters out most competitors.

## The Paradox of Success

The most successful founders approach enormous problems obliquely. Bill Gates started with a Basic interpreter for a small user base. Mark Zuckerberg built a college networking site before dominating globally.

## Seven Frighteningly Ambitious Ideas

1. New Search Engine
2. Replace Email
3. Replace Universities
4. Internet Drama
5. The Next Steve Jobs
6. Bring Back Moore's Law
7. Ongoing Diagnosis

## Strategic Tactics

**Start Small, Think Big**: Launch with seemingly modest projects that reveal their scope after gaining traction.

**Embrace Uncertainty**: "Empirically it may be better to have a blurry" vision than a clear one.

## My Takeaway

Navigate westward like Columbus—establish what works, then expand incrementally. Don't announce your ultimate ambition.
