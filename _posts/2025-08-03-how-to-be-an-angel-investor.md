# How to Be an Angel Investor

Paul Graham's essay [How to Be an Angel Investor](http://www.paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html) demystifies angel investing for those considering this path.

## Mechanics Are Simple

Deal structures matter far less than founders think. "When you hear people talking about a successful angel investor, they're not saying 'He got a 4x liquidation preference.' They're saying 'He invested in Google.'"

## Picking Winners is Paramount

The critical skill is identifying strong startups *before* they're obviously successful. This requires judging founder quality before validation exists.

## People Over Markets

Bet on "relentlessly resourceful" founders who can adapt. Good founders discover good markets; the correlation is strong.

## Deal Flow Through Relationships

Startups are found through personal referrals. Becoming a known, reliable investor creates an expanding pipeline.

## Practical Advice

- Start with small investments ($10k-$50k)
- Use standard legal templates
- Commit or decline decisively—avoid stringing founders along
- Help broadly and trust reciprocal goodwill

## My Takeaway

Success comes from company selection, not negotiation tactics. "It's too much overhead" to track favors.
