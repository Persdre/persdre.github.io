# Superlinear Returns

Paul Graham's essay [Superlinear Returns](http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html) argues that performance rewards are rarely proportional to effort—small differences yield dramatically different results.

## Two Fundamental Causes

**1. Exponential Growth**: When success compounds (more customers attract more customers, more knowledge enables faster learning), outcomes accelerate.

**2. Thresholds**: Step functions create dramatic outcome shifts. A slightly better product doesn't capture partial market share—it wins decisively or fails.

## Key Insights

- **Compounding work matters**: Direct compounding and learning-based compounding both drive exponential returns
- **Independence is expanding**: Technology reduces organizational gatekeeping
- **Inequality is inevitable**: Fields with superlinear returns show extreme outcome variation

## Practical Guidance

- Pursue work matching natural aptitudes and deep interests
- Take calculated risks; avoid conservative approaches
- Follow curiosity over careerism
- Embrace "doing things that don't scale" initially

## My Takeaway

Luck remains significant but multiplies through early risk-taking. Superlinear returns reward bold action.
