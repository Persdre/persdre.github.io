# Relentlessly Resourceful

Paul Graham's essay [Relentlessly Resourceful](http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html) argues that the defining quality of successful startup founders is being "relentlessly resourceful."

## The Problem with "Hapless"

"Hapless implies passivity. To be hapless is to be battered by circumstances" rather than shaping outcomes.

## Why Relentlessness Alone Isn't Enough

In startups, obstacles are unpredictable. You cannot simply "plow through" problems because you don't know their difficulty beforehand. Resourcefulness—the ability to adapt and try new approaches—is essential.

## Can This Quality Be Taught?

Graham suggests it surprisingly can be, especially for young people conditioned by authority structures. Schools and corporations actually reward obedience over resourcefulness.

## Practical Applications

Founders should ask themselves if they embody this quality. Investors should evaluate cofounders using this metric.

## My Takeaway

Combine determination with flexibility. The combination—relentlessly resourceful—is what separates successful founders from everyone else.
