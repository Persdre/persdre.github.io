# Earnestness

Paul Graham's essay [Earnestness](http://www.paulgraham.com/earnest.html) defines a quality that distinguishes the best founders and builders.

## The Definition

Earnestness combines right motives with maximum effort. It means "doing something for the right reasons, and trying as hard as you can"—correct direction and magnitude of motivation.

## Why It Matters in Startups

Silicon Valley attracts many with misaligned incentives—seeking wealth and fame rather than solving problems genuinely. "Interest in the problem for its own sake" distinguishes earnest founders from those chasing external rewards.

## Connection to Nerd Culture

Earnestness aligns with being a "nerd"—caring deeply about a subject independent of social status or material gain. This willingness to sacrifice coolness for authentic passion becomes increasingly valuable as challenges grow beyond superficial problems.

## The Paradox: Naïveté as Strength

Earnest people often seem naïve because they don't fully grasp others' competing motives. However, this innocence provides advantages:
- Genuine curiosity energizes problem-solving
- "Naive optimism" helps combat outdated assumptions in rapidly changing fields

## Historical Context

Historically, business lacked intellectual interest, making earnestness seem misplaced there. Modern startups have changed this equation, increasingly aligning "intellectual curiosity and money"—two powerful forces now more compatible than ever.

## My Takeaway

Be earnest. Care about the problem. Try your hardest. It sounds simple, but it's rare and powerful.
