# Charisma / Power

Paul Graham's essay [Charisma / Power](http://www.paulgraham.com/pow.html) explores the paradox that powerful individuals lacking charisma face disproportionate criticism.

## The Problem

Those in power without charisma become easy targets. This affects CEO "builders" who prioritize execution over social charm.

## The Paradox

Individuals best equipped for demanding roles—focused on substantive work rather than interpersonal maneuvering—tend to be penalized socially.

## The Reality

"I don't think there is any solution to this problem. It's human nature."

## Graham's Conclusion

Rather than fixing this, recognize that being a "magnet for criticism" may indicate someone is the right person for the job. Heavy criticism isn't disqualification—it can signal competence focused on results over popularity.

## My Takeaway

Accept this tension as inherent to leadership. Don't expect it to disappear; use it to identify the real builders.
