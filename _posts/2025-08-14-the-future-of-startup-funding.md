# The Future of Startup Funding

Paul Graham's essay [The Future of Startup Funding](http://www.paulgraham.com/future.html) argues that startup funding is fundamentally shifting as founders gain power relative to investors.

## The Opportunity

Startups increasingly need hundreds of thousands rather than millions. VCs' business models require large investments. This mismatch creates space for new investor types.

## Super-Angels as Disruptors

"The super-angels are really mini VC funds" competing directly with traditional VCs. Unlike VCs treating angel investments as deal flow, super-angels focus entirely on early-stage funding.

## Predicted Changes

**Angel Rounds Will:**
- Use rolling closes instead of fixed sizes
- Employ convertible notes with valuation caps
- Remove traditional lead investor management
- Feature standardized paperwork

## VC Evolution

Some will adapt by doing more, smaller deals. Others will drift into later-stage investing without realizing the shift.

## The Broader Vision

Empowering founders benefits everyone. Founders understand their companies better than investors. "Make something people want" applies to the investment process itself.

## My Takeaway

Removing investor-related stress makes entrepreneurship more attractive, ultimately increasing deal flow and benefiting everyone.
