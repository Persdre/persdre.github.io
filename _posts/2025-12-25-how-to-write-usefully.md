# How to Write Usefully

Paul Graham's essay [How to Write Usefully](http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html) argues that essays should aim beyond mere persuasion.

## The Definition

Useful writing must be "correct" yet avoid vagueness by making "claims that are as strong as they can be made without becoming false."

## Four Components of Usefulness

These function multiplicatively:

1. **Correctness** — statements must be true
2. **Novelty** — ideas should surprise readers or articulate unconscious knowledge
3. **Importance** — the subject must matter to many people
4. **Strength** — claims expressed as unequivocally as possible without becoming false

## The Morris Technique

Graham adopts a strategy from his friend Robert Morris: only publish ideas you're confident about. "Delete it and try again" rather than settling for weak claims.

He proofreads extensively, sometimes reading sentences 100 times before publication.

## Achieving Each Component

- **Importance**: Write about topics that matter to you personally
- **Novelty**: Deep expertise helps identify surprising insights
- **Strength**: Balance confident thinking with skillful qualification

## The Controversy Problem

Novel essays create resistance. Contradicting "cherished beliefs" and stating claims "flatly" provokes defensive reactions.

## My Takeaway

Start by narrowing your scope to areas where you possess genuine expertise, even with minimal readership.
