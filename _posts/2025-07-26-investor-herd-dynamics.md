# Investor Herd Dynamics

Paul Graham's essay [Investor Herd Dynamics](http://www.paulgraham.com/herd.html) argues that investor decision-making is heavily influenced by other investors' choices.

## The Herd Effect

"The biggest component in most investors' opinion of you is the opinion of other investors." One investment triggers others. Yet popularity with investors correlates poorly with eventual success.

## Why Later Investors Increase Valuation

- Early investors took greater risks and deserve returns
- The company is literally more valuable after raising capital
- Warning: Some investors react emotionally to price increases

## Four Mechanisms Behind Momentum

1. **Improved fundamentals**: Raising capital reduces failure risk
2. **Founder confidence**: Investors sense success through founder demeanor
3. **Information asymmetry**: Mediocre investors copy others
4. **Deadline pressure**: Advanced negotiations prompt competing offers

## Strategic Advice

- Be truthful about competing offers without revealing names
- Don't artificially manufacture urgency
- The difficulty of first commitment stems from herd dynamics, not you

## My Takeaway

Initial investor hesitation reflects external forces. Subsequent investments become easier once momentum begins.
