# How Y Combinator Started

Paul Graham's essay [How Y Combinator Started](http://www.paulgraham.com/ycstart.html) recounts Y Combinator's founding on March 11, 2005.

## The Problem YC Solved

Seed funding was "very haphazard" before YC, with inconsistent deal terms and unclear documentation. They aimed to standardize seed investment using their experience from founding Viaweb.

## The Synchronous Funding Innovation

YC's most transformative idea—funding multiple startups simultaneously—wasn't initially strategic. The summer program structure proved unexpectedly perfect for their model.

## Reputation Building

The organization faced initial skepticism. YC "was dismissed as one initially," which paradoxically aligned with their strategy of funding unconventional "toy" ideas others overlooked.

## Location Strategy

The move to Silicon Valley emerged from practical constraints but proved strategically ideal, positioning YC at the startup ecosystem's center.

## My Takeaway

Great opportunities arise from combining practical necessity with ambitious vision. The best models are often discovered rather than designed.
