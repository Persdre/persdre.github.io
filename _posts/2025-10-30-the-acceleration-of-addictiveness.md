# The Acceleration of Addictiveness

Paul Graham's essay [The Acceleration of Addictiveness](http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html) argues that technological progress systematically creates increasingly addictive versions of existing things.

## The Pattern of Concentration

"Hard liquor, cigarettes, heroin, and crack have in common is that they're all more concentrated forms of less addictive predecessors."

Progress refines substances and experiences into more potent forms—the same mechanism that improves solar efficiency also creates more dangerous drugs.

## Inevitability Through Progress

The acceleration is unavoidable because it stems from general technological advancement, which cannot be selectively restricted without becoming oppressive.

## Growing Scope

Contemporary examples demonstrate widening impact: processed foods, social media platforms, and interactive entertainment have all become dramatically more engaging than their predecessors.

## Cultural Lag

Society develops "antibodies" to addictions, but slowly—cigarette normalization took roughly a century to reverse. Technological change now outpaces cultural adaptation.

## Personal Response

Graham describes his own strategies—avoiding smartphones, taking long hikes—as eccentric but increasingly necessary for maintaining focus and autonomy.

## My Takeaway

As addictiveness intensifies, distinguishing normal behavior from healthy behavior becomes harder. We must consciously reject appealing new technologies.
