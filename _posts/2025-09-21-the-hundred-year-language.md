# The Hundred-Year Language

Paul Graham's essay [The Hundred-Year Language](http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html) explores what programming languages might look like in 100 years.

## Language Evolution

Languages form evolutionary trees with dead-ends. Graham predicts Java will become an "evolutionary dead-end" like COBOL—not because it's unsuccessful now, but because it won't produce meaningful descendants.

## Core Language Matters

The fundamental operators determine long-term survival. "The more of a language you can write in itself, the better."

## Efficiency as Non-Issue

With vastly faster hardware, wasting programmer time through awkward syntax becomes worse than wasting machine cycles. Version 1 programs should prioritize ease of writing over performance.

## Flattening Data Structures

Specialized types like strings or arrays might not need to be fundamental. They could be implemented as optimizations rather than core features.

## Design Methodology

Write the program you'd like to code regardless of compilation feasibility. Optimize for parse-tree brevity as a proxy for effort required.

## My Takeaway

Understanding which languages will matter long-term helps us choose better languages today. Bet on the main evolutionary branch.
