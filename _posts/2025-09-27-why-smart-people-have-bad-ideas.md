# Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas

Paul Graham's essay [Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html) explains why capable people frequently propose unprofitable startup ideas.

## The Still Life Effect

The primary culprit is choosing the first idea that comes to mind, then becoming emotionally invested. "You come up with a random idea, plunge into it, and then at each point feel you've put so much time into it that this must be the idea."

## Divided Loyalties

Graham's ambivalence about business hindered his early venture Artix. He wanted to remain connected to the art world rather than fully committing to profit. "The purpose of a company...is to make money."

## Fear-Based Thinking

Founders avoid competitive markets out of intimidation, selecting weaker alternatives instead. Those intimidating VC-backed competitors are often underperforming.

## The Solution

Smart people can learn to identify customer needs. The T-shirt slogan captures it: "Make something people want."

## My Takeaway

Bad ideas from smart people are a training problem, not an ability problem. Apply your intelligence to understanding what customers actually need.
