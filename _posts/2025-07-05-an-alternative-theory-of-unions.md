# An Alternative Theory of Unions

Paul Graham's essay [An Alternative Theory of Unions](http://www.paulgraham.com/unions.html) proposes that high-paying union jobs were a temporary economic aberration.

## The Growth Industry Context

Manufacturing in the 1950s was expanding rapidly. Companies prioritized speed over efficiency: "If there's some mundane problem getting in your way, and there's a simple solution that's somewhat expensive, just take it."

## Workers as Infrastructure

Graham compares workers to servers in internet startups—valuable for reliable supply rather than minimal cost. Growing firms overspend on necessities to avoid delays.

## The Aberration Theory

High union wages represented temporary market conditions, not permanent moral achievements. Graham uses 1990s internet consulting as analogous—unsustainable compensation from exceptional circumstances.

## Decline Explanation

Modern growth industries (tech, services) don't require the same labor-intensive infrastructure that 1950s manufacturing did.

## My Takeaway

The era of powerful unions was situational, not ideological—an economic quirk of a specific historical moment.
