# Good and Bad Procrastination

Paul Graham's essay [Good and Bad Procrastination](http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html) argues procrastination isn't inherently harmful—what matters is what you're avoiding and what you're doing instead.

## Three Types of Procrastination

1. **Type A**: Avoiding work to do nothing
2. **Type B**: Avoiding important tasks for less important ones
3. **Type C**: Postponing minor tasks to focus on significant work (the "good" kind)

## Errands as Productivity Killers

"Work that has zero chance of being mentioned in your obituary" includes cleaning, email, errands. These consume time needed for meaningful work.

## The Danger of Type-B

This masked form feels productive while misdirecting energy toward trivial tasks. Nearly everyone engages in this without recognizing it.

## Big Problems Require Uninterrupted Time

Certain work demands extended, uninterrupted stretches—conditions errands systematically destroy.

## My Takeaway

Let genuine interest pull you toward ambitious projects rather than pushing through obligation. This naturally deprioritizes less meaningful tasks.
