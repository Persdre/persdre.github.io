# How People Get Rich Now

Paul Graham's essay [How People Get Rich Now](http://www.paulgraham.com/richnow.html) argues that wealth creation has shifted from inheritance to entrepreneurship.

## Historical Shift

In 1982, 60% of the richest Americans inherited their wealth. By 2020, this dropped to 27%. About three-quarters of new fortunes derive from founding companies.

## 1982 Was the Anomaly

In 1892, only about 20% of millionaires inherited wealth, and many gained "their initial edge from new technology." The mid-20th century's corporate dominance was unusual.

## Why Startups Became Possible Again

J.P. Morgan's era created oligopolies that made independent ventures nearly impossible. Deregulation, technological disruption, and company decay weakened these monopolies.

## Decreasing Startup Costs

Technology has dramatically lowered barriers: more people start companies, founders negotiate better investor terms, and companies reach billion-dollar valuations faster.

## Timeline of Growth

- IBM (1896): 45 years to $1B revenue
- Microsoft (1975): 13 years
- Modern companies: 7-8 years

## My Takeaway

Rising inequality reflects structural changes, not moral decline. When founding companies becomes feasible, naturally more people pursue it.
