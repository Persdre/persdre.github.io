# A Fundraising Survival Guide

Paul Graham's essay [A Fundraising Survival Guide](http://www.paulgraham.com/fundraising.html) argues that raising money is the second-hardest aspect of starting a company—and can destroy a startup if not managed carefully.

## Why Fundraising is Brutal

- Markets are unforgiving—investors evaluate startups like customers, not employers
- Few investors exist (typically ~10 interested parties)
- "Investors are very random. All investors...are by ordinary standards incompetent"
- Investors heavily influence each other, creating herd behavior

## Nine Survival Strategies

1. **Lower Your Expectations**: Assume deals will fall through
2. **Keep Working**: One founder handles meetings while others maintain momentum
3. **Be Conservative**: Accept reasonable offers rather than gambling for better terms
4. **Stay Flexible**: Show investors multiple paths forward
5. **Pursue Independence**: Target "ramen profitability"
6. **Don't Take Rejection Personally**: VCs reject nearly everyone
7. **Have a Consulting Fallback**: Shift toward client work rather than collapse
8. **Avoid Inexperienced Investors**: Novice angels create disproportionate burden
9. **Know Where You Stand**: Focus energy on the most likely prospects

## My Takeaway

The biggest danger is surprise. Underestimating difficulty leads to demoralization and failure.
