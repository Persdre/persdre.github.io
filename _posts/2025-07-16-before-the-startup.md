# Before the Startup

Paul Graham's essay [Before the Startup](http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html) advises college students preparing for entrepreneurship.

## Six Counterintuitive Points

**1. Counterintuitive Nature**: Startup success defies normal instincts. Exception: "trust your gut" about people.

**2. Expertise Misconception**: Deep startup knowledge isn't essential. Focus on "understanding your users really well."

**3. Gaming Stops Working**: "You have to make something people want, and you prosper only to the extent you do."

**4. All-Consuming Nature**: Founding consumes your life for years. Don't start in college—pursue breadth-first exploration.

**5. Unpredictability**: No one can reliably predict who'll succeed as a founder.

**6. Idea Generation**: Avoid consciously brainstorming startup ideas. Let ideas emerge from expertise and curiosity.

## Core Recommendation

"Just learn." Pursue genuine intellectual curiosity, reach technological frontiers, and remain open to serendipity.

## My Takeaway

Apple, Google, and Facebook didn't start by seeking startup ideas. They emerged naturally from the founders' interests.
