# Taste for Makers

Paul Graham's essay [Taste for Makers](http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html) argues that taste is not subjective—it's a learnable skill essential to creating excellent work.

## Taste is Real

Contrary to modern relativism, taste can be objectively better or worse. As practitioners improve, they recognize their former preferences were inferior.

## Ten Principles of Good Design

1. **Simplicity**: Remove ornamentation; address the core problem
2. **Timelessness**: Design for permanence, not fashion
3. **Solves the Right Problem**: Address actual user needs
4. **Suggestiveness**: Leave room for interpretation
5. **Slight Humor**: Great work often contains understated wit
6. **Difficulty**: Hard constraints force elegant solutions
7. **Apparent Ease**: Excellence masks enormous effort
8. **Symmetry**: Repetition and recursion create coherence
9. **Natural Resemblance**: Nature's solutions offer proven models
10. **Redesign**: Expect iteration; embrace reconstruction

## Community Matters

Great work clusters around concentrated talent centers. Individual genius requires supportive ecosystems.

## My Takeaway

Develop exacting taste paired with execution ability. Recognize flawed solutions others accept and possess the skill to propose better alternatives.
