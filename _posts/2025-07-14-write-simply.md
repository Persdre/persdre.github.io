# Write Simply

Paul Graham's essay [Write Simply](http://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html) advocates for clear writing using ordinary words and straightforward sentences.

## Reader Engagement

Simple writing reduces cognitive friction. "The easier something is to read, the more deeply readers will engage with it."

## The Saltimbocca Principle

Ideas should "leap into your head and you barely notice the words" conveying them—prioritizing content over style.

## Consideration & Accessibility

Writing simply is ethically considerate. It serves non-native English speakers whose idea comprehension exceeds language proficiency.

## Honesty & Longevity

Complicated writing can mask empty thinking. Simple writing demands substance and ages better across changes.

## Personal Motivation

"It offends me not to" write simply. Overcomplicated sentences feel clumsy rather than fancy.

## Method

Rapid first drafts followed by extensive editing focused on cutting unnecessary elements.

## My Takeaway

Simple writing isn't dumbed down. It's the hardest kind—requiring you to actually have something to say.
