# How to Think for Yourself

Paul Graham's essay [How to Think for Yourself](http://www.paulgraham.com/think.html) argues that certain professions—science, investing, entrepreneurship, and essay writing—require independent thinking to succeed.

## The Key Distinction

Most work only demands correctness, not novelty. Recognizing which category your chosen field falls into is crucial for career satisfaction.

## Independent-Mindedness as Innate

The tendency toward independent or conventional thinking appears largely inborn. People often misjudge where they fall on this spectrum.

Graham notes: "schools generally ignore independent-mindedness, except to the extent they try to suppress it."

## Cultivating Independent Thought

**Social Environment**: Surrounding yourself with independent-minded peers encourages unconventional thinking. High school environments often suppress it due to conformist pressure.

**Intellectual Exposure**: Seek diverse perspectives—meet people with unusual knowledge, read history, travel. This expands your idea sources.

**Skepticism as Practice**: Actively question accepted claims. Ask "Is that true?" This helps identify flawed assumptions concealing novel insights.

## Three Components

Independent-mindedness comprises three interchangeable elements:

1. **Fastidiousness about truth**: Carefully calibrating belief degrees rather than rushing toward extremes
2. **Resistance to conformity**: An active delight in counterintuitive ideas, not mere negativity
3. **Curiosity**: The primary driver of novel idea discovery

These components can substitute for each other, creating multiple valid models of independent thinking.
