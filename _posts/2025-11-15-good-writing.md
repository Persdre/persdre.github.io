# Good Writing

Paul Graham's essay [Good Writing](http://www.paulgraham.com/goodwriting.html) argues that writing that sounds good is more likely to be right—these two qualities are deeply connected.

## The Central Thesis

"Writing that sounds good is more likely to be right." This challenges the assumption that these qualities are unrelated.

## Mechanical Constraint as Improvement

When forced to rewrite passages due to space constraints, Graham found the revisions were always better. "You couldn't bear it, any more than gravity could bear things floating upward."

## The Bin-Shaking Analogy

Arbitrary constraints on writing function like shaking a bin of objects. Repeated adjustments lead to better arrangement without reducing quality.

## Reading as Discovery

The writer is the first reader. Better-sounding prose is easier to reread repeatedly, making it simpler to detect problems: "does anything catch? Does anything feel wrong?"

## Rhythm Reflects Ideas

Good writing's rhythm matches the natural shape of thought itself. When an essay flows well, it typically expresses ideas accurately—writers often work on both simultaneously without distinction.

## Important Limitation

This principle applies only when writing *develops* ideas, not when describing pre-formed ones (textbooks, reports).
