# Mind the Gap

Paul Graham's essay [Mind the Gap](http://www.paulgraham.com/gap.html) argues that income variation in modern democracies signals economic health rather than injustice.

## The "Daddy Model" of Wealth

A childhood misconception persists into adulthood: viewing wealth as "something that flows from parents" rather than something created through productive work. This model wrongly treats wealth as fixed.

## Historical Context

Most human history featured wealth accumulation through theft—taxation, raiding, confiscation. Only with the rise of the middle class did wealth creation become the primary path to riches. "Behind every great fortune, there is a crime" was once accurate.

## Technology's Leveling Effect

While technology increases income gaps, it paradoxically reduces other disparities. Modern mass-produced goods provide quality comparable to luxury alternatives.

## Income Variation as Health Indicator

"Increasing variation in income is a sign of health" in modern societies, indicating technological advancement and productive capacity growth.

## My Takeaway

Suppressing income variation through high taxation reduces overall wealth creation. Focus on absolute living standards, not relative equality.
