# The Venture Capital Squeeze

Paul Graham's essay [The Venture Capital Squeeze](http://www.paulgraham.com/vcsqueeze.html) argues that VCs face a four-directional squeeze threatening their business model.

## The Four Problems

**1. Excess Capital**: VCs raised enormous sums during the Bubble and struggle to deploy them. "I don't know what we're going to do. Maybe we'll just have to give some of it back."

**2. Falling Startup Costs**: Open source eliminates licensing expenses. Moore's Law makes hardware nearly free. Web marketing reduces promotion costs. Better programming languages reduce development needs.

**3. Sarbanes-Oxley Burden**: This regulation imposes "$2 million a year" compliance costs and deters experienced executives from leading public companies, effectively killing the IPO market for startups.

**4. Direct Acquisition by Giants**: Companies like Google acquire promising startups before Series A funding, recognizing they need only the software and developers.

## The Implications

Graham contrasts his 1995 startup's $38,000 in initial costs against today's ability to obtain equivalent resources for nearly nothing. This fundamentally changes what startups need from VCs.

## My Takeaway

The VC model evolved for a different era. As startup costs plummet, founders have more leverage than ever. Use it wisely.
