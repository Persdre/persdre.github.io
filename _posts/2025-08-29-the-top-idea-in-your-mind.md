# The Top Idea in Your Mind

Paul Graham's essay [The Top Idea in Your Mind](http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html) argues that the most important idea occupying your thoughts determines what you accomplish.

## The Power of Ambient Thought

Essential thinking occurs without conscious effort—particularly in relaxed moments like showering. This unconscious processing solves difficult problems, but you can only influence it indirectly.

## The Startup Money Problem

"Once you start raising money, raising money becomes the top idea in your mind." This displacement prevents meaningful progress on actual product work.

## Two Dangerous Mental Occupants

- **Money matters**: Getting funding demands constant attention
- **Disputes**: Conflicts have addictive quality despite lacking substance

## Indirect Control Strategy

You cannot directly command your thoughts, but you can control situations you enter. Avoid circumstances that make urgent but undesirable problems critical.

## My Takeaway

Notice what surfaces during unguarded moments. That's your actual top idea. Then restructure your life accordingly.
