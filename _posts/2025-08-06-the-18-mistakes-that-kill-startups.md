# The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups

Paul Graham's essay [The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html) argues that startup failure stems from one issue: "not making something users want."

## The 18 Mistakes

1. **Single Founder**: Lacking co-founders signals peer rejection
2. **Bad Location**: Operate in startup hubs
3. **Marginal Niche**: Competition indicates viable markets
4. **Derivative Idea**: Don't just copy existing companies
5. **Obstinacy**: Adapt but don't constantly pivot
6. **Hiring Bad Programmers**: Quality matters enormously
7. **Choosing Wrong Platform**: Technical choices have long consequences
8. **Slowness in Launching**: Get feedback early
9. **Launching Too Early**: Don't damage reputation with substandard products
10. **No Specific User in Mind**: Build for people you can talk to
11. **Raising Too Little Money**: Reach milestones for next rounds
12. **Spending Too Much**: Excessive hiring slows effectiveness
13. **Raising Too Much Money**: Creates bloat and reduces flexibility
14. **Poor Investor Management**: Balance respect with independence
15. **Sacrificing Users for Profit**: Create desirability first
16. **Not Getting Hands Dirty**: Do business development yourself
17. **Fights Between Founders**: Choose founders carefully
18. **Half-Hearted Effort**: Full-time commitment correlates with success

## My Takeaway

All 18 are variations on one problem: not making something users want. Focus there first.
