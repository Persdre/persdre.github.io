# Startup = Growth

Paul Graham's essay [Startup = Growth](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html) defines startups by their single distinguishing characteristic: "A startup is a company designed to grow fast."

## What Defines a Startup

A barbershop cannot scale because it's constrained by geography and personal service. Startups require ideas that can reach large markets efficiently.

**Two essential conditions:**
1. Creating something many people want
2. Ability to reach and serve all those people

## Growth as a Compass

Target specific weekly growth rates. 5-7% weekly growth is solid; 10% is exceptional. Using growth as a single optimization metric simplifies decision-making.

## Exponential Value Creation

Small differences in growth rates produce dramatically different outcomes:
- 1% weekly = 1.7x annual
- 5% weekly = 12.6x annual

This mathematical reality explains why startup success is valuable and failure rates high.

## My Takeaway

Understanding startups means understanding growth. It explains technology focus, venture funding attraction, acquisition activity, and why startups fail frequently.
