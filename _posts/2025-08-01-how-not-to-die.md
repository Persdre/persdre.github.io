# How Not to Die

Paul Graham's essay [How Not to Die](http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html) presents a counterintuitive thesis: startup success primarily comes from simply not failing.

## The Mortality Problem

About one-third of funded companies fail, often quietly rather than dramatically. Startups simply "crawl off somewhere and die."

## Detecting Decline

Silent communication is the most reliable death predictor. When Y Combinator stops hearing from founders, company failure follows reliably.

## The Real Killer: Demoralization

While official causes cite funding exhaustion or founder departures, the underlying cause is typically lost morale. Working startups rarely fail mid-project; they fail when people give up.

## Expect Difficulty

Startup founders should anticipate emotional turmoil. Knowing difficulty is normal prevents despair from becoming surrender.

## Fatal Distractions

"But we're going to keep working on the startup" signals actual abandonment. Graduate school, consulting, or secondary projects destroy startups through distraction.

## My Takeaway

Don't give up. Disasters are inevitable—999-in-1000 odds of facing some crisis before success. Persistence through difficulty determines outcomes.
