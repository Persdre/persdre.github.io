# Undergraduation

Paul Graham's essay [Undergraduation](http://www.paulgraham.com/college.html) offers advice on becoming a good hacker during college.

## Becoming a Good Hacker

Excelling as a programmer requires developing strong coding skills and studying challenging problems. Work on "hard problems" through personal projects rather than class assignments.

## Subject Selection

**Mathematics**: Study it "for its own sake" as a source of metaphors and conceptual frameworks.

**Worthy Disciplines**: Math, hard sciences, engineering, history (especially economic/scientific), architecture, and classics.

## The Dropout Graph Method

People switching from math to computer science (but never vice versa) suggests math holds greater intellectual rigor.

## Job Preparation

Skills should match career goals: corporate work requires Windows proficiency; startups demand powerful tools.

## Open Source Contribution

Contributing to existing projects develops real-world experience better than classroom assignments.

## My Takeaway

"Faking stops working" in college. Success requires pursuing what you genuinely love—professors and real problems cannot be fooled.
