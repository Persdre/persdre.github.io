# The Anatomy of Determination

Paul Graham's essay [The Anatomy of Determination](http://www.paulgraham.com/determination.html) argues that determination—not intelligence—is the primary predictor of startup success.

## Intelligence vs. Determination

"While it certainly helps to be smart, it's not the deciding factor." Many intelligent people achieve nothing, suggesting talent alone is insufficient.

## Components of Determination

1. **Willfulness**: The core desire to achieve something "no matter what." Largely innate.

2. **Discipline**: The self-control balancing willfulness. Graham compares them to "two fingers squeezing a slippery melon seed"—both must apply equal pressure.

3. **Ambition**: How you choose your destination. Unlike willfulness, ambition is "quite malleable."

## Cultivability

While willfulness is mostly inborn, both discipline and ambition can be developed.

## Erosion Risk

Success increases temptations, threatening determination's balance unless discipline grows proportionally.

## Beyond Determination

Love for the work provides intrinsic motivation beyond willpower alone.

## My Takeaway

Youth's advantage: inexperience allows overestimating abilities, providing confidence to persist through obstacles.
