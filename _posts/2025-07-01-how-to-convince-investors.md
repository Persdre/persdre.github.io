# How to Convince Investors

Paul Graham's essay [How to Convince Investors](http://www.paulgraham.com/convince.html) presents a straightforward strategy: create something worth investing in, understand why, then explain it clearly.

## The Foundation: Formidable Founders

Investors make snap judgments about founders within minutes. Being formidable means appearing "like they'll get what they want, regardless of obstacles"—justifiable confidence rather than swagger.

## Truth as Your Strength

"You don't have to be a smooth presenter if you understand something well and tell the truth." Domain expertise is essential—investors detect whether you genuinely understand your market.

## Market Requirements

A promising startup needs a plausible path to dominating a large market. Identify the "why now?" factor—what changed recently that makes this viable.

## Handling Rejection

Address rejections candidly. Explain why those investors were mistaken. The best investors recognize that superior ideas initially appear risky.

## The Recipe

1. Build something investable
2. Understand its investment merit
3. Communicate that understanding clearly

## My Takeaway

"Let your startup do the work" rather than relying on pitch perfection.
