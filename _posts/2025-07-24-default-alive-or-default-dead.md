# Default Alive or Default Dead?

Paul Graham's essay [Default Alive or Default Dead?](http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html) argues that founders must regularly assess whether their company will reach profitability.

## The Critical Question

"Assuming their expenses remain constant and their revenue growth is what it has been over the last several months, do they make it to profitability on the money they have left?"

Most founders don't know the answer.

## The Fatal Pinch

A dangerous state combining: being default dead, experiencing slow growth, and lacking sufficient runway. Founders drift into this trap through denial.

## The Hiring Problem

Overhiring is "by far the biggest killer of startups that raise money." Founders mistakenly believe hiring accelerates growth. Large staffs are typically effects of growth, not causes.

## Fundraising Reality

Assuming investors will rescue an underperforming company is unreliable. Need both plan A (fundraising) and plan B (survival without it).

## My Takeaway

Start asking the default alive/dead question earlier. This mindset encourages addressing fundamental product problems instead of unsustainable spending.
