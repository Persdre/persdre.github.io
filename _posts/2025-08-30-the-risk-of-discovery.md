# The Risk of Discovery

Paul Graham's essay [The Risk of Discovery](http://www.paulgraham.com/disc.html) argues that we systematically underestimate the risks taken by famous scientists.

## The Hindsight Bias Problem

We judge past scientific choices through what succeeded. Newton's focus on physics appears obviously correct now, but "in Newton's day the three problems seemed roughly equally promising"—physics, alchemy, and theology.

## Equal Risk, Unequal Outcomes

Newton pursued three major intellectual bets. Only one succeeded. His "smartness and the craziness were not as separate as we think."

## Reframing "Crazy" Pursuits

What appears wasteful in retrospect—Newton's alchemy and theology work—represented reasonable gambles at the time. These fields were "huge, if true."

## My Takeaway

Breakthrough discoveries require willingness to pursue risky, unconventional paths. Apparent irrationality in great thinkers often reflected genuine uncertainty about which pursuits would prove fruitful.
