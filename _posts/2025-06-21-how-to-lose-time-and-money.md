# How to Lose Time and Money

Paul Graham's essay [How to Lose Time and Money](http://www.paulgraham.com/selfindulgence.html) argues that fortunes and time are lost through similar mechanisms—not obvious self-indulgence, but deceptive activities that bypass our alarms.

## On Losing Money

Most fortunes are lost through "bad investments" rather than excessive spending. Spending triggers alarms, but investing doesn't because it feels virtuous.

## On Losing Time

The most dangerous time-waster isn't leisure, but "fake work"—activities that appear productive but yield nothing. Email management exemplifies this trap: it feels like work because it's done at a desk, yet accomplishes nothing.

## The Core Problem

Our evolutionary alarms against self-indulgence no longer protect us. "The most dangerous traps now are new behaviors that bypass our alarms...by mimicking more virtuous types."

## My Takeaway

Both money and time are protected by developing new awareness systems. Instinctive caution against pleasure is insufficient in complex modern environments.
