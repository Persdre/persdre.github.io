# RAQs (Rarely-Asked Questions)

Paul Graham's essay [RAQs](http://www.paulgraham.com/raq.html) compiles questions he finds particularly thought-provoking.

## On Learning Art and Hacking

"Both seem from the outside like great abstruse mysteries" and are best learned young when confidence exceeds knowledge.

## On Historical Knowledge

Rather than comprehensive surveys, read focused books on specific topics to maintain interest.

## On Career Advancement

To avoid becoming a detached manager, stay a programmer and choose startup environments where advancement doesn't require management.

## On Teaching Excellence

Effective teachers maintain high standards, genuinely care for students, and demonstrate authentic interest in subject matter.

## On Startup Selection

When choosing between opportunities, prioritize "the most determined and smartest founders" as an investor would evaluate stock prospects.

## On Learning Programming

A motivated person can achieve functional programming ability "in 6 months to a year," ideally through hands-on work at a startup.

## My Takeaway

The questions asked less frequently often reveal the most about how someone thinks.
