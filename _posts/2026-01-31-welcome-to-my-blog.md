# Welcome to My Thoughts

This is my first blog post! Here I'll share reflections on research, life as a PhD student, and everything in between.

## Why Start a Blog?

As a PhD candidate, I've learned so much through conversations with mentors, peers, and collaborators. Writing helps me organize my thoughts and hopefully share insights that might be useful to others on similar journeys.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:
- **Research insights**: Lessons learned from my work on LLM Multi-Agent Systems and Trustworthy AI
- **PhD life**: The ups and downs of the academic journey
- **Career reflections**: Thoughts on navigating academia and industry
- **Life lessons**: General musings on personal growth and well-being

Feel free to reach out if any post resonates with you or if you'd like to discuss further!
