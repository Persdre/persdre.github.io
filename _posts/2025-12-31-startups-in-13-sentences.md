# Startups in 13 Sentences

Paul Graham's essay [Startups in 13 Sentences](http://www.paulgraham.com/13sentences.html) distills startup wisdom into thirteen foundational principles.

## The 13 Sentences

1. **Pick good cofounders.** This is like location in real estate—foundational and hard to change.

2. **Launch fast.** Learn what users actually need, not what you imagine they need.

3. **Let the idea evolve.** Startups aren't mere execution of initial concepts.

4. **Understand your users.** This drives most success. Maximize "how much you improve their lives."

5. **Better to make a few users love you than many users like you.** "It's easier to expand userwise than satisfactionwise."

6. **Offer surprisingly good customer service.** This reveals user insights you can't get any other way.

7. **You make what you measure.** Measurement itself improves results.

8. **Spend little.** Obsessive cost discipline preserves runway and optionality.

9. **Get ramen profitable.** This changes investor dynamics dramatically.

10. **Avoid distractions.** Especially paid work that pulls you away.

11. **Don't get demoralized.** Prevent demoralization through conscious effort.

12. **Don't give up.** "Sheer effort is usually enough" in startups, unlike fields requiring innate talent.

13. **Deals fall through.** Avoid over-depending on any single deal.

## The Core Insight

Understanding users ultimately sustains morale during inevitable challenges and informs nearly every other principle on the list.
