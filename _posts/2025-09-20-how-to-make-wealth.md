# How to Make Wealth

Paul Graham's essay [How to Make Wealth](http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html) argues that starting a startup is the most reliable way to get rich by creating wealth rather than merely accumulating money.

## Wealth vs. Money

"Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places." Money is merely the medium of exchange. Most people confuse creating actual value with earning currency.

## The Productivity Multiplier

A skilled programmer in a startup can be 36+ times more productive than a corporate employee through:
- Working longer hours (2x)
- Better focus (3x)
- Eliminating bureaucracy (2x)
- Superior intelligence relative to job expectations (3x)

## Two Requirements for Wealth Creation

1. **Measurement**: Performance must be quantifiable
2. **Leverage**: Decisions must have significant impact

## Why Startups Are Small

"Small groups can be select"—you need the best people, not average performers diluting results.

## Technology as Leverage

New techniques multiply value across many users, unlike service businesses limited by individual capacity.

## My Takeaway

Competitors determine work intensity. Success involves massive luck—most startups tank. But the payoff ranges from zero to exponential.
