# Programming Bottom-Up

Paul Graham's essay [Programming Bottom-Up](http://www.paulgraham.com/progbot.html) argues that experienced Lisp programmers build the language upward toward the problem.

## The Fundamental Principle

While top-down design breaks problems into subroutines, bottom-up design lets programmers "write operators" as needs emerge. Language and program evolve together.

## Not Just Reordering

Bottom-up design produces "a larger language with more abstract operators, and a smaller program written in it. Instead of a lintel, you'll get an arch."

## Four Advantages

1. **Efficiency**: Smaller, more agile programs with fewer error connection points
2. **Reusability**: Utilities become assets for future projects
3. **Readability**: General-purpose abstractions are easier to understand
4. **Clarity**: Identifying recurring patterns reveals simpler design possibilities

## Why Lisp

Lisp enables broader language augmentation than other languages, making bottom-up design central to Lisp programming culture.

## My Takeaway

The best programs transform the language to match the problem domain. This requires thinking in two directions at once.
