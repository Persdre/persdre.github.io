# Hackers and Painters

Paul Graham's essay [Hackers and Painters](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html) argues that hacking and painting are fundamentally similar creative endeavors.

## Hacking as Making

"Computer science" is a misnomer. Hackers create software as makers, like painters or architects. The term misleads hackers into adopting scientific pretenses when they should embrace creative design.

## Learning by Doing

Unlike scientists who master existing knowledge first, hackers learn by creating original (though initially poor) work from the beginning. They improve iteratively, like painters developing through sequential works.

## Design Over Engineering

Great software requires designing specifications alongside implementation, not rigid pre-planning. Flexible languages enable sketching and refinement—the hacker's equivalent to a painter's preliminary studies.

## The Startup Advantage

Big companies dampen design variation through committees, reducing risk but also excellence. Startups win by uniting design and implementation in capable individuals.

## Empathy as Essential

Understanding users' perspectives distinguishes great hackers from merely intelligent ones. Software must intuitively communicate purpose without manuals.

## My Takeaway

Programs should be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. Hacking is a maker's discipline—study creative fields, not just computer science theory.
