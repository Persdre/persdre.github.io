# Beating the Averages

Paul Graham's essay [Beating the Averages](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html) argues that startups gain competitive advantage by using superior programming languages their competitors won't adopt.

## The Viaweb Case Study

Graham and Morris founded Viaweb using Lisp, an unconventional choice. The company grew from 70 stores to over 1,000 before Yahoo acquired it. Approximately 20-25% of the code utilized macros—features uniquely powerful in Lisp.

## The Blub Paradox

A "Blub" programmer (using a median-level language) can perceive weaker languages as obviously inferior, yet cannot see more powerful languages as superior—they appear "weird" rather than more capable.

## Competitive Advantage

Competitors remained "glued immovably to the median language" due to professional habits and institutional momentum, unable to match Lisp's development velocity.

## Practical Advice

Analyze competitor job postings to gauge technical sophistication. Lisp positions would signal genuine technical threats.

## My Takeaway

Technology choices are strategic decisions. Using a more powerful language can provide sustainable competitive advantage if competitors can't or won't match you.
