# What We Look for in Founders

Paul Graham's essay [What We Look for in Founders](http://www.paulgraham.com/founders.html) outlines five essential qualities Y Combinator seeks.

## Five Key Qualities

**1. Determination**
The most critical quality, contrary to the belief that intelligence matters most. Founders must persist through obstacles without becoming discouraged.

**2. Flexibility**
Balance determination with adaptability. Like a running back—committed to forward progress but adjusting direction as needed.

**3. Imagination**
The ability to generate surprising ideas. "Good ideas seem bad initially" because obvious ones already exist.

**4. Naughtiness**
A "piratical gleam" and delight in breaking minor rules. They care deeply about major moral questions but enjoy subverting conventions.

**5. Friendship**
Strong founder relationships are empirically crucial. Successful startups have founders who genuinely like and understand each other.

## My Takeaway

Determination trumps intelligence. Imagination means your ideas should seem wrong to most people at first.
