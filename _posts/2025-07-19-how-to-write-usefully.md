# How to Write Usefully

Paul Graham's essay [How to Write Usefully](http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html) argues that essays should aim to be useful rather than merely persuasive.

## The Four Components

1. **Correctness**: Make claims "as strong as they can be made without becoming false"
2. **Novelty**: Tell readers something they didn't know
3. **Importance**: Ideas must matter to people
4. **Strength**: Express ideas unequivocally; use qualification strategically

## Process & Practice

"Loose, then tight": draft quickly with diverse ideas, then rewrite meticulously. Reread relentlessly, removing passages that "catch your sleeve."

## The Backlash Problem

Strong, novel, correct writing provokes resistance. Readers dislike contradictions to cherished beliefs. Misrepresentation is common.

## Opportunity

The internet democratized essay publication. Most valuable essays remain unwritten, and corresponding undiscovered ideas await.

## My Takeaway

Write what matters to you. Be correct, novel, important, and strong. The world needs more useful writing.
