# How to Do What You Love

Paul Graham's essay [How to Do What You Love](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html) argues that to excel at work, you must genuinely enjoy it—yet most people are misdirected about this truth.

## The Problem with Childhood Conditioning

Children learn to view work and fun as opposites. School becomes tedious preparation for worse adult work, creating a false binary that undermines later career satisfaction.

## Defining the Bounds

Meaningful work requires:
- More enjoyment than temporary pleasures (lower bound)
- Work you'd pursue even without payment (authenticity test)
- Something admirable enough to inspire pride (upper bound)

## Major Obstacles

**Prestige**: Pursuing prestigious careers means chasing what seems impressive rather than what interests you. "Prestige is just fossilized inspiration."

**Money**: Financial incentives combined with prestige create dangerous career traps.

## Two Routes

1. **Organic route**: Gradually increase enjoyable work components as you gain seniority
2. **Two-job route**: Work undesirable jobs for income while pursuing passion separately

## My Takeaway

Real discipline lies in discovering what you love, not forcing yourself through unpleasant work. "Always produce" serves as both discipline and discovery mechanism.
