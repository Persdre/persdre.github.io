# Life is Short

Paul Graham's essay [Life is Short](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html) argues that life is genuinely short—not merely a figure of speech.

## The Numbers

Convert time into discrete quantities:
- You get only 52 weekends with a two-year-old
- Roughly 8 experiences of Christmas-as-magic with your child
- If you see your parents once a year after leaving home, maybe 20 more times total

These finite numbers reveal life's true brevity.

## Identifying Bullshit

The essay emphasizes eliminating "bullshit"—activities that lack authenticity or reward:
- Unnecessary meetings
- Pointless disputes
- Bureaucracy
- Posturing
- Dealing with other people's mistakes
- Traffic jams
- Addictive but unrewarding pastimes

Some bullshit is forced upon us. Other forms we voluntarily embrace through self-deception. Online arguing exemplifies the latter—our defensive instincts make us waste time defending ourselves against strangers.

## Distinguishing What Matters

Not everything society deems important actually matters. Ask: will you regret spending time on this?

Genuine meaningful activities—like coffee with friends or playing with children—don't feel wasted in retrospect. Artificially important concerns fade.

## Three Practices

1. **Ruthlessly eliminate wasted time**
2. **Act immediately on important goals** rather than postponing
3. **Consciously savor experiences**

## My Takeaway

Cultivate impatience about priorities instead of constantly dwelling on mortality. Pruning waste, pursuing significance, and appreciating the present—that's how to spend limited time wisely.
