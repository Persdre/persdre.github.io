# The Age of the Essay

Paul Graham's essay [The Age of the Essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html) argues that school essay instruction has been distorted by historical accident.

## School Essays Are Corrupted

Writing instruction became entangled with literature study, forcing students to write about "symbolism in Dickens" rather than topics they find genuinely interesting.

## Essays Shouldn't Defend Positions

Real essays differ from the "thesis + supporting arguments + conclusion" formula. That structure derives from medieval legal disputations. Essays should instead begin with questions, not answers.

"An essay is something you write to try to figure something out." You discover conclusions through writing, not defend ones chosen beforehand.

## Essays Follow Natural Curiosity

Good essays meander like rivers seeking the sea—following interesting threads rather than plotting direct routes. They prioritize finding surprises: unexpected facts that contradict assumptions.

## Observation and Disobedience Matter

Developing essay skills requires noticing things others miss, asking "why" about apparent wrongness, and ignoring what you're "supposed" to write about.

## My Takeaway

The Internet enables anyone to publish, judging work by quality rather than author credentials. Write to figure things out, not to defend positions.
