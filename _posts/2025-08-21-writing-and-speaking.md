# Writing and Speaking

Paul Graham's essay [Writing and Speaking](http://www.paulgraham.com/speak.html) argues that writing and speaking are fundamentally different skills with opposing priorities.

## The Primacy of Ideas in Writing

"Having good ideas is most of writing well." A writer with clear thinking can express themselves plainly and still be perceived as stylistically accomplished.

## Ideas Matter Less in Speaking

"Having good ideas is an alarmingly small component of being a good speaker." Entertainment matters more than substance for speakers.

## The Ad-Lib Dilemma

Engaging speakers speak extemporaneously, but this limits thinking time. Speakers "might spend no more time thinking about each sentence than it takes to say it."

## Audience Dynamics

Audiences become collectively less intellectually rigorous than individual readers. They respond to emotional manipulation, making "being a good speaker increasingly a matter of being a good bullshitter."

## Legitimate Speaking Value

Talks excel at motivation and provide intimate access to notable figures—potentially more important than transmitting ideas.

## My Takeaway

Choose your medium based on your goal. Write when ideas matter. Speak when motivation and connection matter.
