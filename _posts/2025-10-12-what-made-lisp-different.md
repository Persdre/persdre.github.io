# What Made Lisp Different

Paul Graham's essay [What Made Lisp Different](http://www.paulgraham.com/diff.html) identifies nine revolutionary concepts McCarthy introduced with Lisp in the late 1950s.

## The Nine Ideas

**1. Conditionals**: McCarthy invented the if-then-else construct, which later became standard.

**2. First-Class Functions**: "Functions are first class objects—they're a data type just like integers, strings, etc."

**3. Recursion**: Lisp became the first programming language to support recursion.

**4. Pointer-Based Variables**: Variables act as pointers to values; values carry type information.

**5. Garbage Collection**: Automatic memory management built in from the start.

**6. Expression-Based Programs**: "Lisp programs are trees of expressions, each of which returns a value."

**7. Symbol Type**: Symbols allow pointer-based equality testing.

**8. Tree Notation**: Code represented as symbolic trees enabled meta-programming.

**9. Unified Execution Model**: "There is no real distinction between read-time, compile-time, and runtime."

## Current State

Ideas 1-5 are now widespread. Concepts 8-9 remain largely unique to Lisp dialects.

## My Takeaway

Understanding Lisp's innovations helps you see what modern languages are still missing.
