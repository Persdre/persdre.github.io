# How to Fund a Startup

Paul Graham's essay [How to Fund a Startup](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html) explains startup funding as a process of shifting gears—raising just enough at each stage to reach the next level.

## The Five Funding Sources

**1. Friends and Family**: Most accessible but mixes personal relationships with business. Non-accredited investors can complicate legal matters.

**2. Consulting**: Maintains revenue but trades financial security for entrepreneurial urgency. Becomes a "weed tree" distraction.

**3. Angel Investors**: Individual wealthy investors who provide capital and networks. Key leverage: pursue multiple alternatives simultaneously.

**4. Seed Funding Firms**: Companies investing small amounts early-stage. Focus on people over ideas.

**5. Venture Capital**: Organized funds managing others' money. Lower-tier firms are hungrier but potentially less trustworthy.

## Critical Insights

**Valuation Reality**: "In early stage investing, valuations are voodoo." They're artificial metrics that become meaningful only as companies mature.

**One Shot with VCs**: Rejection spreads through networks quickly, making startups "shopworn." Approach when you can actually convince them.

**Deals Fall Through**: "Birds fly; fish swim; deals fall through." Pursue alternatives until money clears.

**Cheapness is Power**: Low burn rates preserve options and negotiating leverage.

## My Takeaway

The funding ladder exists to get you to the next stage—nothing more. Keep costs low, maintain leverage, and never stop pursuing alternatives until the money is in the bank.
