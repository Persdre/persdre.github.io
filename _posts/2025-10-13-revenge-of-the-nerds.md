# Revenge of the Nerds

Paul Graham's essay [Revenge of the Nerds](http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html) argues that programming languages vary significantly in power, yet most managers ignore this reality.

## The Pointy-Haired Boss Problem

Non-technical managers assume all programming languages are equivalent and choose based on perceived industry standards rather than actual merit. This assumption is comfortable but fundamentally wrong.

## Language Evolution

Modern languages are gradually approaching Lisp's capabilities, which originated in 1958. "It's 2002, and programming languages have almost caught up with 1958."

Lisp wasn't designed as a practical programming language but as a mathematical exercise—Steve Russell unexpectedly converted McCarthy's theoretical notation into a functional interpreter.

## Lisp's Nine Revolutionary Ideas

1. Conditionals
2. First-class functions
3. Recursion
4. Dynamic typing
5. Garbage collection
6. Expression-based programs
7. Symbols
8. Code-as-data notation
9. Metaprogramming capabilities

Most are now mainstream; macros remain uniquely Lisp.

## Competitive Advantage

Using powerful languages dramatically increases development speed. ITA Software: "one line of Lisp can replace 20 lines of C."

## My Takeaway

For demanding software projects, choose the most powerful language available. Superior technology often outweighs hiring concerns.
