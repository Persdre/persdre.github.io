# Keep Your Identity Small

Paul Graham's essay [Keep Your Identity Small](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html) argues that fruitful discussions become impossible when topics engage people's identities.

## Why Religion and Politics Are Problematic

These topics uniquely devolve into unproductive arguments. Anyone feels qualified to opine because they rely on conviction rather than knowledge.

## The Identity Problem

"People can never have a fruitful argument about something that's part of their identity." When positions become extensions of self, rational discussion becomes impossible.

## It's Not About the Topic

Discussions about Bronze Age battles don't degenerate because nobody has identity stakes. Programming language debates do because developers identify with their tools.

## Broader Application

Seemingly neutral topics (Ford vs. Chevy) can trigger identity-based arguments depending on participants. The variable is identity, not subject matter.

## The Solution

"Let as few things into your identity as possible." Minimizing self-labels improves thinking clarity across all domains.

## My Takeaway

Acquiring fewer identity categories leads to better reasoning. Notice when you're defending your identity rather than seeking truth.
