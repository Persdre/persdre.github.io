# How to Get New Ideas

Paul Graham's essay [How to Get New Ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/getideas.html) argues that novel ideas come from recognizing anomalies—what appears unusual, absent, or malfunctioning.

## The Anomaly Detection Method

Noticing gaps and inconsistencies is the primary pathway to innovation. This appears in everyday observations, particularly comedy, but reaches greatest potential at knowledge frontiers.

## Fractal Nature of Knowledge

"Knowledge grows fractally. From a distance its edges look smooth, but when you learn enough to get close to one, you'll notice it's full of gaps."

As expertise deepens, previously invisible opportunities become apparent.

## Opportunity in Gaps

These knowledge gaps seem inexplicably overlooked—observers wonder why previous thinkers haven't explored certain territories. Investigating gaps generates new research domains.

## My Takeaway

Curiosity and critical observation are entrepreneurial superpowers. The deeper you go, the more gaps you see.
