# Billionaires Build

Paul Graham's essay [Billionaires Build](http://www.paulgraham.com/ace.html) argues that the path to extreme wealth comes from creating products that genuinely delight users.

## What Y Combinator Seeks

YC's fundamental criterion is "Make something people want." Startups lack the power to force unsuitable products on customers, so they must create genuine value.

## The "Larval Market" Concept

Successful startups begin in small but expandable markets. The ideal: founders "living in the future"—operating at the leading edge while building solutions they personally want.

## Interview Strategy

YC partners seek authentic understanding of user needs through candid questioning. The strongest indicator: already having real users who want the product, even in rough form.

## What Billionaires Share

Genuine interest in their work—not money alone. Billionaire founders could have exited earlier but continued because they "couldn't let it go."

## Why Exploitative Founders Fail

People motivated primarily by exploitation become bad founders. They take shortcuts, deceive cofounders, and rarely achieve significant scale.

## My Takeaway

The reliable path to billionaire status involves building companies that grow rapidly by consistently satisfying user demands.
