# Relentlessly Resourceful

Paul Graham's essay [Relentlessly Resourceful](http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html) answers a simple question: if you had to describe the ideal startup founder in one phrase, what would it be?

The answer: **relentlessly resourceful**.

## The Definition

Founders should be the opposite of "hapless"—passive, battered by circumstances, giving up when things are hard.

Being relentlessly resourceful combines two qualities:
- **Relentless**: Not giving up
- **Resourceful**: Finding new ways forward when blocked

Both are necessary. Relentlessness alone isn't enough because startup obstacles are novel and unpredictable. You can't simply plow through problems—you must keep trying new things.

## Why This Matters for Startups

This trait differs from success recipes in other fields like writing or painting, where internal obstacles (self-doubt, lack of skill) dominate.

In startups, external obstacles are primary. The market pushes back. Customers don't want what you built. Technical problems arise. Competitors appear. Each obstacle requires a new approach.

## Can It Be Taught?

Surprisingly, Graham claims this quality can be taught to many people, especially younger individuals accustomed to authority structures.

The key is realizing that obstacles aren't walls—they're puzzles. There's always another angle to try.

## As a Self-Assessment Tool

If you're wondering whether to start a company, ask yourself: Am I relentlessly resourceful?

If you're building a team, use this as a filter for who you bring on.

## My Takeaway

This phrase serves as a compass. When stuck, I ask: am I being relentlessly resourceful, or am I being hapless? The answer usually suggests the next move.
