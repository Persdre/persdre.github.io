# Copy What You Like

Paul Graham's essay [Copy What You Like](http://www.paulgraham.com/copy.html) argues that authentic development requires copying only what you genuinely appreciate, not what society deems prestigious.

## Early Mistakes in Imitation

Graham describes misguided copying:
- High school: imitating depressing literary fiction he didn't enjoy
- College: mimicking impenetrable philosophy papers lacking content
- Graduate school: pursuing fashionable but hollow expert systems

## The Core Problem

"I believed these things were good because they were admired." He confused social prestige with genuine merit.

## Practical Solutions

1. **Ignore presentation**: Judge art or ideas stripped of context—would you value it at a garage sale?

2. **Examine guilty pleasures**: What you read when avoiding virtue-signaling reveals authentic preference.

3. **Copy the essence**: Historical painters imitated the *brown* of Renaissance masters (actually accumulated dirt) rather than their brilliant technique.

## My Takeaway

"You have to figure out for yourself what's good. You can't trust authorities." Distinguish between genuine appreciation and being impressed.
