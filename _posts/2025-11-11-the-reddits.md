# The Reddits

Paul Graham's essay [The Reddits](http://www.paulgraham.com/reddits.html) tells the origin story of Reddit and its founders.

## The Origin

Steve and Alexis were undergraduates at the University of Virginia who traveled to Harvard to hear Graham's startup talk. Though their initial fast-food ordering app idea wasn't viable, Graham was so impressed with them that he decided to launch Y Combinator partly to fund founders like them.

## The Pivot

When Y Combinator rejected their original idea, Graham suggested an alternative: create a dedicated link-sharing platform inspired by del.icio.us/popular. The Reddits accepted this pivot while traveling home, getting off their train to commit to building what became Reddit.

## Founder-Product Alignment

"Reddit has a certain personality—curious, skeptical, ready to be amused" that mirrors Steve's intellectual curiosity and skepticism toward authority. This alignment made the platform uniquely suited to its founders' values.

## Competitive Advantage

Unlike Slashdot, which used human moderators, Reddit let users submit content directly. This meant Reddit's content stayed fresher and newer.

## Sustainable Success

Reddit proved "almost unkillable" due to its fundamental utility. Despite management struggles after Steve left, traffic continued growing steadily.
