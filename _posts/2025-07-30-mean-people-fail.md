# Mean People Fail

Paul Graham's essay [Mean People Fail](http://www.paulgraham.com/mean.html) observes that successful people he knows are remarkably rarely mean.

## Meanness Impairs Performance

"Being mean makes you stupid." Fighting diverts mental energy toward situation-specific tactics rather than big-picture thinking.

## Talent Recruitment

Mean founders cannot attract top talent. "The best people have other options," so they gravitate toward leaders who treat them well.

## Intrinsic Motivation Wins

Founders driven by money accept acquisition offers. Those pursuing world improvement persist longer. Benevolence provides competitive advantage.

## Historical Shift

Success historically meant controlling scarce resources through conflict. Modern success depends on innovation and idea creation, requiring civil order and psychological safety.

## Intellectual Work Goes Mainstream

The collaborative dynamics governing intellectual pursuits now dominate broader industries, "reversing the historical polarity of the relationship between meanness and success."

## My Takeaway

Parents and leaders should discourage meanness not just morally but pragmatically—it's become a direct barrier to achievement.
