# Organic Startup Ideas

Paul Graham's essay [Organic Startup Ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/organic.html) argues that the best startup ideas emerge from solving problems in your own life.

## Two Types of Startup Ideas

1. **Organic ideas**: Grow from founders' personal experiences (Apple, Google, iPhone)
2. **Made-up ideas**: Identified as needed by others from external perspective

"The most successful startups seem to be closer to the Apple type."

## Why Organic Ideas Matter

Young founders lack experience predicting others' needs. Organic ideas often don't feel like business opportunities—they're just personal projects solving genuine frustrations.

## Finding Breakable Problems

Ask yourself: "What do you wish someone would make for you?" There are "always great ideas sitting right under our noses."

## The Toy Dismissal Test

Products initially dismissed as toys often indicate overlooked opportunities. Early computers, planes, and cars all faced this skepticism.

## The Gold Mine Principle

"An unmet need that is just becoming fixable" represents the most valuable startup opportunity.

## My Takeaway

Young founders are positioned at technology's frontier, using cutting-edge tools first. That's where problems emerge.
