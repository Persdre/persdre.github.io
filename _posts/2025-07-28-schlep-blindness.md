# Schlep Blindness

Paul Graham's essay [Schlep Blindness](http://www.paulgraham.com/schlep.html) explores how our unconscious minds prevent us from recognizing valuable startup ideas that involve tedious, unpleasant work.

## The Reality of Business

Founding companies requires unglamorous work. Many hackers want to start ventures through coding alone, but "schleps are not merely inevitable, but pretty much what business consists of."

## Unconscious Avoidance

The problem isn't conscious decision-making but subconscious rejection. Our minds shield us from ideas involving painful work we'd rather avoid.

## Stripe as Prime Example

Despite thousands of hackers experiencing frustrating payment systems, most chose to build recipe sites instead—simply because addressing payments seemed intimidating.

## The Competition Advantage

Ambitious ideas requiring substantial schleps face less competition. "Everyone else will have been frightened off by the challenges involved."

## Overcoming Blindness

Two strategies: leverage ignorance (younger founders don't grasp difficulty), and shift perspective—ask what problems you'd want solved *for others* rather than yourself.

## My Takeaway

The best ideas often hide behind tedious work. Train yourself to see through schlep blindness.
