# Why TV Lost

Paul Graham's essay [Why TV Lost](http://www.paulgraham.com/convergence.html) explains how computers defeated TV through replacement rather than convergence.

## Four Key Forces

**1. Open Platform Architecture**: "Anyone can build whatever they want on it, and the market picks the winners."

**2. Moore's Law & Bandwidth**: Exponential increases in internet capacity made streaming viable.

**3. Piracy & User Convenience**: Users embraced unauthorized distribution because the experience surpassed legitimate alternatives.

**4. Social Applications (Most Powerful)**: Desire to connect with peers drove universal computer adoption.

## The Critical Insight

"Facebook killed TV." Interpersonal connection fundamentally redirected audience attention away from broadcast media toward networked computing.

## Structural Weaknesses Exploited

The internet dissolves two broadcast pillars: synchronicity (scheduled programming) and locality (regional distribution). Viewers now demand on-demand, interest-based content.

## My Takeaway

Open platforms with rapid innovation cycles will defeat closed systems. Social connection is more compelling than entertainment quality alone.
