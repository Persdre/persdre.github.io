# How to Be Silicon Valley

Paul Graham's essay [How to Be Silicon Valley](http://www.paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html) argues that Silicon Valley's success stems from people, not geography.

## The Core Insight

"If you could get the right ten thousand people to move from Silicon Valley to Buffalo, Buffalo would become Silicon Valley."

## Two Essential Ingredients

1. **Rich people**: Specifically investors with technology experience who provide funding, advice, and connections
2. **Nerds**: Talented technical people drawn to innovation

Government investment doesn't work—"bureaucrats by their nature are the exact opposite sort of people from startup investors."

## The Role of Universities

First-rate universities act as magnets for talented individuals. A new world-class university could be built quickly by recruiting top researchers en masse.

## Personality and Attractiveness

Successful startup hubs share characteristics:
- Well-preserved neighborhoods over suburbs
- Locally-owned businesses instead of chains
- Tolerance for unconventional ideas

## My Takeaway

Startups beget startups through a self-reinforcing cycle. "You can't be somewhat of a startup hub"—it's either self-sustaining or nonexistent.
