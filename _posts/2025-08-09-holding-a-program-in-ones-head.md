# Holding a Program in One's Head

Paul Graham's essay [Holding a Program in One's Head](http://www.paulgraham.com/head.html) argues that excellent programming requires maintaining an entire codebase mentally.

## The Problem with Breaking Focus

Programmers operate near their cognitive limits. "The wrong kind of interruption can wipe your brain in 30 seconds." Scheduled interruptions prevent deep work from starting.

## Eight Practical Recommendations

1. Eliminate distractions (especially scheduled ones)
2. Work in extended sessions
3. Use succinct programming languages
4. Continuously rewrite code for cleaner design
5. Prioritize code readability
6. Maintain small teams
7. Prevent multiple authors on identical code
8. Begin projects small

## Organizational Contradiction

Organizations require interchangeable workers, but programming demands individual creative vision. Most large companies inadvertently "do all eight things wrong."

## Strategic Implication

Startups gain competitive advantage by enabling conditions where individual programmers excel—solving problems "in one big brain."

## My Takeaway

Protect your focus ruthlessly. The mental model matters more than the code itself.
