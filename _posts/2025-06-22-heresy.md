# Heresy

Paul Graham's essay [Heresy](http://www.paulgraham.com/heresy.html) argues that the concept of heresy—traditionally religious—has reenergized in secular modern society.

## What Defines Heresy

Two distinctive structural features:
1. Heresy takes priority over truthfulness; labeling something ends discussion regardless of facts
2. A single heretical statement outweighs all other accomplishments—"like dropping a chunk of uranium onto the scale"

## The Mechanism

- Whether a statement counts as heretical depends on *who says it*
- Labels like "x-ist" function as conversational exceptions
- People face firing for expressing certain opinions

## Root Causes

Two necessary ingredients:
1. **Aggressively conventional-minded people** (always present)
2. **A unifying ideology** (currently from the left)

When these align, mob dynamics amplify enforcement.

## My Takeaway

Despite narrowing free expression, longer-term progress continues and signs suggest the current wave is peaking.
