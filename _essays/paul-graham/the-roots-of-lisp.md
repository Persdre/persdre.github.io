# The Roots of Lisp

Paul Graham's essay [The Roots of Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html) examines John McCarthy's 1960 foundational work that makes Lisp unique.

## McCarthy's Innovation

McCarthy demonstrated how "given a handful of simple operators and a notation for functions, you can build a whole programming language." He named it Lisp for "List Processing."

## Two Programming Models

Graham identifies two "clean, consistent models" in programming history—the C model and the Lisp model. Modern language development has progressively adopted Lisp features like runtime typing and garbage collection.

## The Self-Referential Property

The defining quality distinguishing Lisp is "that it can be written in itself"—a recursive property fundamental to understanding the language's essence.

## Why This Matters

Understanding McCarthy's discovery illuminates where programming languages are fundamentally heading. It explains why Lisp maintains multiple dialects unlike more rigid language families.

## My Takeaway

Studying Lisp reveals the semantic core of programming itself. The simplicity of McCarthy's original model shows how much can emerge from a few powerful primitives.
