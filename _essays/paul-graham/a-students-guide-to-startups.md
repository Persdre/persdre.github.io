# A Student's Guide to Startups

Paul Graham's essay [A Student's Guide to Startups](http://www.paulgraham.com/mit.html) argues that the mid-twenties is the optimal time for starting a startup.

## Advantages of Young Founders

1. **Stamina**: Higher energy compensates for inexperience
2. **Financial Flexibility**: Can live on minimal expenses
3. **Rootlessness**: No mortgages or serious relationships limiting mobility
4. **Access to Co-founders**: College concentrates ambitious, technical people
5. **Beneficial Ignorance**: Lack of experience prevents intimidation

## The "Class Project" Problem

Young founders frequently build products resembling academic assignments:
- **Fake Problem-Solving**: Addressing invented problems
- **Wrong Success Metrics**: "The market doesn't give a shit how hard you worked"

## Essential Missing Knowledge

Work experience teaches the brutal relationship between money and survival. It eliminates the "flake reflex" and teaches that you must produce what others want.

## Practical Recommendations

- Infiltrate startup environments informally
- Assess co-founders by demonstrated building ability
- Learn user-focused thinking
- Avoid overly comfortable corporate positions

## My Takeaway

The question isn't "Can I do this?" but "Do I want this enough?" Motivation determines success once intelligence reaches a threshold.
