# How to Raise Money

Paul Graham's essay [How to Raise Money](http://www.paulgraham.com/fr.html) is a comprehensive guide to fundraising. The core message: fundraising is just a means to an end.

## Core Principles

**Don't Raise Unless Necessary**: Only pursue funding if your company needs it to grow faster and can attract investors. Rapid growth is what makes a company a startup, not external funding.

**Commit Fully or Not at All**: Fundraising is extremely distracting. Either enter "fundraising mode" completely or avoid it entirely. Half-measures destroy momentum.

**Treat Investor Interest Skeptically**: Investors naturally delay decisions while preserving options. Regard them as saying no until receiving unequivocal written commitment.

## Strategic Tactics

**Use Parallel Outreach**: Approach multiple investors simultaneously. Serial approaches give investors no competitive pressure to act.

**Get First Commitments First**: The initial investor is often half the total difficulty. Subsequent investors follow more easily due to herd behavior.

**Accept Offers Greedily**: Take acceptable offers as they arrive rather than holding out for better ones.

**Avoid Valuation Obsession**: Valuation ranks third in importance behind securing necessary funds and attracting quality investors.

## Important Warnings

- Commitments aren't real until funds arrive
- Don't sell more than 25% in phase 2 to preserve founder motivation
- Designate one founder for fundraising to prevent team-wide distraction

## My Takeaway

The strongest position is "type A fundraising"—raising money when you don't desperately need it. Being able to reach profitability independently gives you negotiating leverage.
