# What I Worked On

Paul Graham's essay [What I Worked On](http://www.paulgraham.com/worked.html) is an autobiographical account tracing his career across multiple domains.

## The Path

**Early Interests**: Writing and programming outside school. First programming on an IBM 1401 mainframe with punch cards, then microcomputers.

**College and AI**: Initially planned to study philosophy, found it disappointing, switched to AI. Became fascinated by Lisp. Discovered during grad school that symbolic AI was fundamentally flawed.

**Artistic Pursuits**: Pivoted to visual art after realizing paintings could endure for centuries. Attended art schools in Florence and Providence.

**Viaweb**: Observed the emerging web, created Viaweb with Robert Morris—pioneering web-based software. "Low end software tends to eat high end software." Yahoo acquired it.

**Y Combinator**: Financial independence enabled angel investing alongside essays and coding. Co-founded YC with Jessica Livingston, revolutionizing startup funding.

**Return to Lisp**: Final major project: creating Bel, a Lisp interpreter written in itself. Four years of intensive work.

## The Pattern

Seemingly disconnected pursuits ultimately shaped his trajectory. The thread was following curiosity and working on what genuinely interested him.

## My Takeaway

Careers rarely follow straight lines. The key is pursuing what's genuinely interesting and letting the path emerge.
