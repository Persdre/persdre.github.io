# The Four Quadrants of Conformism

Paul Graham's essay [The Four Quadrants of Conformism](http://www.paulgraham.com/conformism.html) classifies people based on two dimensions: conventional vs. independent-minded, and passive vs. aggressive.

## The Four Types

**Aggressively Conventional**: Enforce rules zealously, believe violators deserve punishment. "Crush the outgroup!"

**Passively Conventional**: The largest group. Follow rules but worry about consequences for others rather than actively punishing. "What will the neighbors think?"

**Passively Independent**: Indifferent to rules, largely unaware of them. "To each his own."

**Aggressively Independent**: Instinctively question authority and resist directives. "Eppur si muove" (and yet it moves).

## Personality Over Context

Graham contends that personality drives quadrant placement more than societal context. Children exhibit these traits regardless of arbitrary institutional rules.

## The Problem with Aggressively Conventional

Aggressively conventional people cause disproportionate harm. Modern societies have developed protections—particularly free inquiry principles—to shield independent-minded individuals who generate innovation.

## The Warning

Recent restrictions on idea exploration threaten scientific progress and entrepreneurship. Breakthroughs require thinking differently from prevailing consensus.

## My Takeaway

Know which quadrant you're in. If you want to build new things, cultivate your independence—but be aware of the costs.
