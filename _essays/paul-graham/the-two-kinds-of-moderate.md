# The Two Kinds of Moderate

Paul Graham's essay [The Two Kinds of Moderate](http://www.paulgraham.com/mod.html) distinguishes between two fundamentally different types of political moderates.

## Intentional Moderates

"Trimmers" who actively choose middle positions. Their opinions cluster around the 50-yard line—they acquire beliefs "in bulk" rather than thinking independently about each issue.

## Accidental Moderates

These form their own conclusions on each question separately. Their opinions "will be scattered over a broad range" but average toward the middle. They also "choose their own questions."

## Central Insight

Intentional moderates share ideologues' weakness: dependence on external frameworks. Accidental moderates demonstrate genuine independence by "getting attacked from both right and left."

## Implications for Intellectual Work

Professionals working with ideas must be accidental moderates or risk mediocrity. Those whose work intersects with politics face a binary choice: maintain independence or compromise quality.

## My Takeaway

"Nearly all the most impressive people I know are accidental moderates." Think independently about each issue.
