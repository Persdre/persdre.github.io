# Why It's Safe for Founders to Be Nice

Paul Graham's essay [Why It's Safe for Founders to Be Nice](http://www.paulgraham.com/safe.html) argues that startup founders can afford to be kind without compromising success.

## The Mathematical Foundation

"Making great things is compounded, and rapacity isn't."

If a nice founder extracts only half the revenue from users compared to a ruthless competitor, they'll catch up within 15 weeks due to exponential growth.

More importantly, if niceness enables even a slightly higher growth rate (6% versus 5% weekly), the kind founder will eventually far exceed the rapacious one.

## Why Niceness Works in Startups

Startups succeed through word-of-mouth recommendations from delighted customers. Being rapacious actually harms this mechanism.

"Being rapacious not only doesn't help you do that, but probably hurts."

## The Practical Tradeoff

Founders can consciously embrace kindness while prioritizing growth rate as compensation. Most successful startups make this tradeoff unconsciously—they focus on building excellent products that naturally spread.

## The Counterintuitive Insight

Rather than being driven by money, the most successful founders are motivated by their companies as personal projects, making them resistant to acquisition offers.

## My Takeaway

Be nice. It's not just ethical—it's strategically sound.
