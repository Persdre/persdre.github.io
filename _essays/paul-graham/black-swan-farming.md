# Black Swan Farming

Paul Graham's essay [Black Swan Farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html) reveals how startup investment returns concentrate heavily in a tiny number of winners.

## The Concentration of Returns

"Effectively all the returns are concentrated in a few big winners." Dropbox and Airbnb alone accounted for roughly 75% of Y Combinator's portfolio value. This creates extreme, counterintuitive variation—potentially 1000x differences in outcomes.

## Unpromising Ideas as Opportunities

The best startup ideas initially appear flawed. "If a good idea were obviously good, someone else would already have done it."

Peter Thiel's Venn diagram captures this: the "sweet spot" lies where ideas "seem like a bad idea" yet "is a good idea."

Facebook exemplified this—a site for college students wasting time seemed like a niche market with no revenue potential.

## The Measurement Problem

Paradoxically, the easiest metric to track (post-Demo Day fundraising success) misleads investors. Graham reveals an inverse correlation exists: higher fundraising rates may indicate excessive conservatism.

## The Psychological Challenge

Successfully navigating startup investing requires overriding intuition, similar to pilots ignoring physical sensations during instrument flight.

## My Takeaway

The best opportunities look bad. Obvious opportunities aren't opportunities at all.
