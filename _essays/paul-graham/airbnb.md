# Airbnb

Paul Graham's essay [Airbnb](http://www.paulgraham.com/airbnb.html) documents a remarkable email exchange from early 2009 showing how Graham convinced Fred Wilson to consider investing.

## Graham's Core Position

Airbnb had massive potential despite skepticism. The marketplace model could eventually rival eBay, comparing it to "practically every really big startup" that transforms its original concept.

## Main Selling Points

1. **Team Quality**: The founders' exceptional execution—they were actively "on the ground in NYC hunting down...their users"

2. **Counter-Cyclical Appeal**: During recession, users needed rental income "to pay their rents"

3. **Market Expansion Potential**: The platform would expand from sofas to professional operators

4. **Efficiency**: "Very capital efficient," allowing investor money to stretch further

## Wilson's Skepticism

Wilson remained cautious, doubting whether Airbnb could penetrate the hotel market, though acknowledging "a pretty big opportunity."

## My Takeaway

This exchange illustrates how founder advocacy sometimes matters more than initial market viability metrics.
