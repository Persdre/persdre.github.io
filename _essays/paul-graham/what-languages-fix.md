# What Languages Fix

Paul Graham's essay [What Languages Fix](http://www.paulgraham.com/fix.html) presents a framework for understanding programming languages through the problems they solve.

## The Framework

Rather than analyzing languages by features alone, categorize each language by the specific limitation it was designed to fix.

## Examples

**Low-level abstraction problems:**
- "Assembly language is too low-level" → Algol, Fortran, C

**Insufficient features:**
- "Algol doesn't have enough data types" → Pascal
- "Fortran doesn't have enough data types" → PL/1

**Design philosophy:**
- "Not everything in Simula is an object" → Smalltalk
- "Perl is a kludge" → Python, Ruby

**Paradigm shifts:**
- "Turing Machines are an awkward way to describe computation" → Lisp
- "Programming is not enough like logic" → Prolog

## My Takeaway

Language evolution follows a pattern of incremental problem-solving. Each new language represents developers identifying genuine shortcomings and designing solutions. Practical frustrations drive progress.
