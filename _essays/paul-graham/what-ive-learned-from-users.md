# What I've Learned from Users

Paul Graham's essay [What I've Learned from Users](http://www.paulgraham.com/users.html) reflects on lessons learned from advising Y Combinator's portfolio companies.

## Pattern Recognition

Despite diversity in startups, "most startups have the same problems." This recurring pattern enables YC's advisory model, though it requires individual attention rather than formulaic solutions.

## Personalized Guidance is Essential

The "batch that broke YC" in 2012 showed that scaling beyond 60 startups required dedicating partner groups to smaller cohorts. Startup advising involves O(n²) complexity—it cannot be automated.

## Founders Misidentify Problems

Founders often fail to recognize their actual challenges. They might blame fundraising difficulties when their product is weak, or worry about user acquisition when the "product isn't good enough."

Partners help prioritize which problems are critical.

## Counterintuitive Nature of Startups

"Founders don't listen to us" initially because startup dynamics contradict conventional wisdom. Only experience validates advice, making skepticism understandable.

## Speed Through Focus

YC's value centers on improving founder focus, enabling faster iteration.

**Formula: Speed defines startups. Focus enables speed. YC improves focus.**

## Peer Networks Matter

Beyond partner advice, "great colleagues make you better." YC deliberately clusters ambitious founders, creating energy and generosity that parallels historic innovation centers.
