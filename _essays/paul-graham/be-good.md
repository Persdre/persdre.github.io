# Be Good

Paul Graham's essay [Be Good](http://www.paulgraham.com/good.html) argues that startups should prioritize creating value for users over profit maximization.

## The Counterintuitive Insight

"Make something people want. Don't worry too much about making money" describes charitable behavior, yet successful companies often operate this way.

## Business as Charity Model

Companies like Craigslist and early Google succeeded by focusing on user needs rather than revenue. "They run it like one" while achieving extraordinary success.

## Three Core Benefits of Benevolence

**1. Morale**: User dependence creates motivation. The "tamagotchi effect" ensures founders keep working when people rely on their service.

**2. External Support**: Being good attracts investors, employees, and partners. "The very best hackers tend to be idealistic."

**3. Decision-Making**: Benevolence serves as a reliable compass. Asking "what's best for users?" provides clear direction.

## Long-term Sustainability

Companies initially built on benevolence sometimes shift toward exploitative practices, which ultimately damages them. "Don't be evil" becomes protective.

## My Takeaway

Being good works pragmatically, not just morally—functioning as strategy, not merely values.
