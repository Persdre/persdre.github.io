# How to Make Pittsburgh a Startup Hub

Paul Graham's essay [How to Make Pittsburgh a Startup Hub](http://www.paulgraham.com/pgh.html) argues that Pittsburgh can realistically become a startup hub.

## Attracting Young Talent is Foundational

"Startups are made of people, and the average age of the people in a typical startup is right in that 25 to 29 bracket." Pittsburgh's growing percentage of this demographic is the crucial foundation.

## The Food Scene Signals Promise

The "youth-driven food boom" demonstrates appeal to young professionals. Independent restaurants create neighborhood character that attracts this demographic.

## Historic Architecture as Asset

19th-century buildings offer affordable housing in a place people want to live. Strict historic preservation correlates with economic thriving.

## CMU as Competitive Advantage

Unlike SF (where Stanford is suburban), Pittsburgh's university sits downtown. CMU should become the world's best university—talent magnetism matters more than any "innovation program."

## The Investor Gap

Pittsburgh lacks mature investors, but this matters less with cheaper startup costs, crowdfunding, and programs like Y Combinator.

## My Takeaway

Success requires patience but offers no downside risks. Deepen what already makes the city attractive.
