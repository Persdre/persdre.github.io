# Beyond Smart

Paul Graham's essay [Beyond Smart](http://www.paulgraham.com/smart.html) distinguishes between intelligence and the ability to generate novel ideas.

## The Core Insight

Society conflates these two distinct capabilities. While intelligence is largely innate, discovering new ideas depends on multiple cultivable factors beyond raw mental horsepower.

**Intelligence ≠ Innovation**

Einstein's genius stemmed not from being exceptionally intelligent but from producing groundbreaking concepts. Many genuinely intelligent people contribute little of substance.

## Why We Overvalue Intelligence

Children are constantly measured by intelligence metrics, making it seem paramount. Meanwhile, actual discovery typically comes later, making intelligence "the only game in town" during formative years.

## The Real Ingredients for Discovery

Beyond intelligence, Graham identifies several cultivable elements:
- Obsessive interest in specific topics
- Independent-mindedness
- Willingness to pursue personal projects
- Strong work ethic and adequate rest
- Appropriate social circles
- Writing ability (crucial for certain types of thinking)

## The Hopeful Reframing

While intelligence appears biologically fixed, the other components enabling innovation can be deliberately developed. This offers substantially greater control over potential contributions than a pure intelligence-based model would suggest.

## My Takeaway

You can't become smarter, but you can become more innovative. Focus on what you can control.
