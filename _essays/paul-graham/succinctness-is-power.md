# Succinctness is Power

Paul Graham's essay [Succinctness is Power](http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html) argues that the primary purpose of high-level languages is to compress meaning.

## The Core Thesis

**Succinctness equals power in programming languages.** The measure of a language's effectiveness is how small it makes your programs.

A language failing at this is "like a knife that doesn't cut well, or printing that's illegible."

## Measuring Code Size

Rather than counting lines, Graham proposes measuring "elements"—distinct nodes in a program's abstract syntax tree. This metric better captures conceptual complexity.

## Language Design Principle

The succinctness test serves as a practical guide for language designers. By asking "what can I do to make programs shorter?" designers naturally discover useful abstractions.

## The Restrictiveness Connection

Restrictive languages feel confining because they force longer detours around limitations. A language feels free when it allows naturally short expressions.

## Readability Nuance

"Total effort = effort per line × number of lines." Individual readability can mislead programmers into accepting unnecessarily verbose languages.

## My Takeaway

Fred Brooks observed that programmers produce similar code volumes regardless of language. Succinctness is therefore the key differentiator in development speed.
