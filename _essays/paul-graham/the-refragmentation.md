# The Refragmentation

Paul Graham's essay [The Refragmentation](http://www.paulgraham.com/re.html) argues that today's fragmentation represents a return to historical norms, not an anomaly.

## Mid-Century Cohesion

World War II compressed income through wage controls and 93% top marginal tax rates. Large corporations created a "Duplo economy"—few giant companies dominating each market, standardizing consumer choices and culture.

## Economic Compression

Unions negotiated above-market wages. Executives received below-market compensation with job security. Limited mobility discouraged extracting maximum current earnings.

## The Disintegration

Multiple simultaneous disruptions in the 1970s: vertical integration fragmented, global competition challenged oligopolies, technology trumped economies of scale, deregulation removed protection.

## Technology's Role

Computing acts as "a lever" magnifying individual work capacity, inherently increasing variation in wealth creation potential. "The default tendency will be for economic inequality to increase."

## My Takeaway

Don't view 20th-century cohesion as reproducible through policy tweaks. Those conditions were unrepeatable anomalies. Focus on symptom mitigation rather than eliminating fragmentation itself.
