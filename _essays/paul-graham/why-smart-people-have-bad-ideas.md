# Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas

Paul Graham's essay [Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html) identifies why intelligent founders often pursue weak startup concepts.

## The Core Problem

During Y Combinator's Summer Founders Program, many applicants fell into this category: "promising people with unpromising ideas."

## Three Main Causes

**1. The Still Life Effect**

Founders choose their first idea and become emotionally invested before evaluating alternatives. "The biggest cause of bad ideas is the still life effect: you come up with a random idea, plunge into it" and feel committed due to sunk time.

**2. Choosing "Cool" Over Profitable**

Founders prioritize interesting work rather than revenue-generating work. "Unpleasant work pays" because pleasant work attracts volunteers.

**3. Fear-Based Timidity**

Smart people underestimate their abilities in unfamiliar domains. Graham's team feared competing in e-commerce but later discovered "VC-backed startups are not that fearsome."

## The Solution

Learn to identify customer needs. "Hackers are perfectly capable" of understanding customers without business people. The key insight: "Make something people want."

## Training's Role

Education trains people to solve predetermined problems rather than identify valuable ones.
