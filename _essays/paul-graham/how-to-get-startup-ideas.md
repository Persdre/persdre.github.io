# How to Get Startup Ideas

Paul Graham's essay [How to Get Startup Ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html) challenges the conventional approach to ideation: don't deliberately brainstorm startup ideas. Instead, become "the sort of person who has them."

## The Problem with Forced Ideation

Trying to think up startup ideas produces "bad ideas that sound plausibly good." Graham calls these "sitcom ideas"—like a social network for pet owners. They fail because they lack genuine urgency from real users.

## The "Well" Concept

Successful startups serve a small group with intense needs rather than many people with mild interest. Microsoft's Altair BASIC and Facebook's Harvard-only launch exemplified this: narrow but deep demand creates sustainable growth.

The formula: **few people who want it a lot > many people who want it a little**

## The Organic Approach

The best ideas emerge from lived experience:

**"Live in the future and build what seems interesting."**

Founders notice gaps in their own world, then build solutions:
- Bill Gates encountering the Altair
- Drew Houston forgetting his USB stick (leading to Dropbox)

External stimuli spark prepared minds. The verb should be "notice," not "think up."

## Key Principles

- **Preparation matters**: Expertise in rapidly evolving fields sharpens judgment about what's missing
- **Domain cross-pollination**: Learning multiple fields reveals problems software could solve
- **Remove filters**: Overcome the "schlep filter" (fear of tedious work) and "unsexy filter" (avoiding unglamorous problems)
- **Competition validates demand**: A crowded market often indicates genuine problems worth solving

## My Takeaway

For aspiring builders, building cool projects matters more than entrepreneurship courses. Seek unmet needs in your own life, observe others' frustrations, and maintain curiosity. Ideas will come.
