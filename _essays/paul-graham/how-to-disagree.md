# How to Disagree

Paul Graham's essay [How to Disagree](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html) proposes a framework for evaluating the quality of disagreements.

## The Disagreement Hierarchy

From weakest to strongest:

**DH0 - Name-calling**: Whether crude or articulate, it's merely insult without substance.

**DH1 - Ad Hominem**: Attacking the speaker rather than the argument. Unhelpful because "good ideas often come from outsiders."

**DH2 - Responding to Tone**: Criticizing style rather than substance. This matters less than whether the author is actually correct.

**DH3 - Contradiction**: Simply stating the opposing position without supporting evidence.

**DH4 - Counterargument**: Adding reasoning and evidence to contradiction—the first genuinely convincing form.

**DH5 - Refutation**: Using direct quotes to identify and explain specific errors. Rare because it requires substantial work.

**DH6 - Refuting the Central Point**: The most powerful disagreement—attacking the author's main argument rather than peripheral details.

## Why This Matters

Higher-quality disagreement makes conversations better and people happier. Being mean becomes unnecessary "when you have a real point to make."

## My Takeaway

Before engaging in a disagreement, ask: what level am I operating at? Am I actually addressing the central point, or am I getting distracted by tone and peripheral issues?
