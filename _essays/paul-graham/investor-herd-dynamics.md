# Investor Herd Dynamics

Paul Graham's essay [Investor Herd Dynamics](http://www.paulgraham.com/herd.html) explains how investor opinions heavily influence other investors, creating cascading effects.

## The Core Phenomenon

When one investor commits, others follow, potentially leading to exponential interest—what's known as a "hot deal."

## Success ≠ Stampede

"Lots of startups that cause stampedes end up flaming out" while many extremely successful companies generated only moderate initial investor interest. Stampedes aren't reliable indicators of startup quality.

## Why the Herd Effect Occurs

1. **Improved Risk Profile**: Money raised literally makes your company more valuable
2. **Founder Confidence**: As fundraising progresses, founders project increased confidence
3. **Mediocre Judgment**: "Judging startups is hard even for the best investors" and weaker ones follow the crowd
4. **Practical Deadlines**: Competing offers create urgency

## Strategic Guidance

Avoid manipulating these forces but don't exaggerate competitive interest. Be transparent with preferred investors while protecting confidentiality about rival conversations.

## The Initial Challenge

Most startups experience the opposite dynamic initially—investors remain distant. Understanding this external resistance helps founders persist toward that crucial first commitment.
