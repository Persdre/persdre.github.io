# How You Know

Paul Graham's essay [How You Know](http://www.paulgraham.com/know.html) argues that reading's value lies not in what we consciously remember, but in how it reshapes our mental models.

## The Memory Problem

We remember surprisingly little from books we've read multiple times. This seems wasteful until reconsidered through a different lens.

## The Compilation Metaphor

"Your mind is like a compiled program you've lost the source of. It works, but you don't know why." Reading reshapes your internal models even after explicit memories fade.

## Multiple Readings Matter

Since your brain "compiles" information differently depending on your current state, rereading important books is worthwhile. You'll extract fresh insights each time.

## Future Implications

As technology advances, people may replay experiences intentionally—not to relive pleasure, but to extract fresh insights from them.

## My Takeaway

The harvest from reading is smaller in observable memory but larger in invisible mental development. Read to change how you think, not to accumulate facts.
