# Ramen Profitable

Paul Graham's essay [Ramen Profitable](http://www.paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html) defines a crucial milestone for startups: generating enough revenue to cover founders' living expenses.

## The Definition

Ramen profitability "buys you time" rather than signaling traditional business success. It differs from conventional profitability, where companies spend millions before achieving substantial revenues.

## Why It Matters

This concept is feasible primarily for software startups with minimal costs beyond founder salaries.

## Four Key Advantages

**1. Negotiating Power**: Founders no longer depend on investor funding, preventing exploitation and stalling tactics.

**2. Investor Appeal**: It demonstrates that customers will pay, founders focus on user needs, and the team maintains disciplined spending.

**3. Morale Boost**: The psychological shift when "survival is the default" provides substantial motivation.

**4. Uninterrupted Development**: Avoiding fundraising rounds eliminates months of distraction.

## Important Caveat

Don't transform into a consulting firm. Ramen profitability serves as a survival mechanism, not an endpoint—startups must ultimately scale into product companies for genuine success.

## My Takeaway

Get to ramen profitable as fast as possible. It changes everything about your negotiating position and psychology.
