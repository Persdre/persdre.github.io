# Keep Your Identity Small

Paul Graham's essay [Keep Your Identity Small](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html) explains why discussions about politics and religion deteriorate so uniquely.

## The Core Problem

These topics don't require expertise to participate in—only strong convictions. JavaScript discussions involve a threshold of knowledge that naturally filters participants. Politics and religion don't.

## Identity as the Root Cause

The real issue isn't the topics themselves, but that they become intertwined with people's identities. When someone identifies as a member of a particular group, "people can never have a fruitful argument about something that's part of their identity."

Any topic can devolve into unproductive debate if participants identify strongly with it. Programming languages often trigger "religious wars" because programmers identify as Python or JavaScript advocates rather than approaching the subject objectively.

## The Practical Solution

The most intriguing implication: clearer thinking comes from minimizing identity commitments.

Rather than claiming membership in various groups, "let as few things into your identity as possible."

## The Exception

Graham notes that identifying as a scientist might be worthwhile since it commits you to following evidence rather than defending predetermined beliefs—functioning more as an empty placeholder than a restrictive label.

## My Takeaway

The less your identity is wrapped up in your positions, the more clearly you can think about them. Define yourself by your curiosity, not your conclusions.
