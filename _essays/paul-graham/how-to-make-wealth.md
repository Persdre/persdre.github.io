# How to Make Wealth

Paul Graham's essay [How to Make Wealth](http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html) explains why startups work as wealth-creation vehicles and why the alternative—a conventional career—is often less efficient.

## Wealth vs. Money

These are different concepts:
- **Wealth**: Stuff we want—food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, experiences
- **Money**: A medium for exchanging wealth

Focusing only on money obscures how actual value is created.

## The Pie Fallacy

Many people wrongly believe wealth is fixed—that if someone gets richer, someone else must get poorer. This is false. Restoring a car increases total wealth without impoverishing anyone. Startups fundamentally disprove zero-sum thinking.

## Measurement and Leverage

The path to wealth requires two conditions:

**Measurement**: Working in small groups where individual contributions are visible. In large companies, your output is averaged with everyone else's.

**Leverage**: Technology is "the way we all do things." Creating solutions that benefit many multiplies impact beyond individual effort.

Startups provide both naturally.

## Why Startups Work

A talented individual might generate 36x more value than expected through:
- Working longer hours
- Greater focus and output per hour
- Eliminating corporate bureaucracy
- Exceeding job description expectations

Small, elite teams can move quickly on hard problems that larger competitors cannot pursue due to bureaucratic constraints.

## Difficulty as Advantage

Hard problems create competitive advantage and barriers to entry. If something is easy, everyone can do it—no leverage.

## My Takeaway

Wealth creation, not money-chasing, builds genuine fortunes. The startup path trades a stable, slower accumulation for a compressed, intense, all-or-nothing gamble. It's not for everyone, but for capable individuals seeking significant outcomes, it's the most direct path.
