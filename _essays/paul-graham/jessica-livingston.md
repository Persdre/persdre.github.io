# Jessica Livingston

Paul Graham's essay [Jessica Livingston](http://www.paulgraham.com/jessica.html) argues that her contributions to Y Combinator have been systematically underrecognized.

## Co-founder Equality

YC was not a "one-man show." Jessica and Graham decided to start it together. They ran operations jointly, with "Jessica and I were a couple" fundamentally shaping the organization's character.

## Culture as Core Product

The family-like atmosphere YC cultivated became its actual product. "At YC, the culture was the product." Jessica defined this culture, establishing authenticity as central to identifying promising founders.

## The "Social Radar"

Jessica possessed exceptional ability to judge character and detect dishonesty. During interviews, while others asked technical questions, they would ultimately defer: "What does the Social Radar say?"

## Why Recognition Lagged

- Graham's visibility as a writer gave YC his name
- Jessica avoided public attention
- Media defaulted to crediting the male founder

## My Takeaway

Character assessment built YC's alumni network—arguably its most valuable feature. Human curation created lasting value.
