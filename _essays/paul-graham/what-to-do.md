# What to Do

Paul Graham's essay [What to Do](http://www.paulgraham.com/do.html) proposes three fundamental principles for how to live.

## Three Principles

1. **Help people** — A basic moral obligation
2. **Take care of the world** — Environmental stewardship
3. **Make good new things** — Create original works of value

## Why Making New Things Matters

"The best kind of thinking, or more precisely the best proof that one has thought well, is to make good new things."

This encompasses scientific discoveries, art, music, and any original creation that demonstrates deep understanding.

## Historical Context

Traditional answers to "What should one do?" emphasized being wise, honest, and just—virtues applicable mainly to the landowning class with predetermined roles.

Today, more people can choose their work, making creation a viable path previously unavailable to most.

## On Newness

Originality is essential. Copying work—even one's own—lacks the impressiveness of genuine innovation. Historically overlooked forms often become recognized as valuable.

## On Balance

Makers should ensure their creations don't harm people or the world. Interestingly, groundbreaking work often helps humanity unintentionally.

## The Invitation

If you believe you can create something remarkable, "you should probably just go ahead and do it."
