# A Word to the Resourceful

Paul Graham's essay [A Word to the Resourceful](http://www.paulgraham.com/word.html) identifies a crucial pattern: unsuccessful startups were "hard to talk to."

## The Pattern Observed

Unsuccessful founders seemed distant and difficult to engage with. Successful founders demonstrated the quality of being able to "take care of themselves."

## The Connection

The essay traces this to "a word to the wise is sufficient." Intelligent people grasp full implications from minimal information, just as resourceful founders turn a simple introduction into funding.

## The Underlying Problem

The issue wasn't stupidity but "conservatism that comes from weakness." Unsuccessful founders approached new ideas cautiously, avoiding uncomfortable conclusions.

## The Real Issue

Being hard to talk to was a symptom. The core deficit: unsuccessful founders failed to pursue funding, users, and new ideas with the same energy successful founders did.

## My Takeaway

Resourcefulness requires willingness to follow implications wherever they lead, even to uncomfortable places.
