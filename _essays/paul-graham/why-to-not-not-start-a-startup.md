# Why to not Not Start a Startup

Paul Graham's essay [Why to not Not Start a Startup](http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html) argues that many people unnecessarily hesitate to start startups, and most objections are unfounded.

## Success is Achievable

Y Combinator's early data showed roughly 50% of their first batch succeeded, with founders becoming wealthy within two years. Long-term success rates around 25% are significantly better than commonly cited figures.

## Failure Isn't Catastrophic

Even unsuccessful founders report positive experiences. "0% of that first batch had a terrible experience." Failed founders often transition successfully to new ventures or secure profitable exits.

## Common Objections Are Overblown

Concerns about age, inexperience, intelligence, business knowledge, and lack of cofounders are systematically refuted. "Starting a startup just doesn't require that much intelligence" for most ventures.

## Ideas Evolve Naturally

Approximately 70% of startup ideas change within three months. This fluidity means initial ideas matter less than founder capability.

## Real Constraints Are Few

Only legitimate barriers include family obligations and certain psychological traits. Most other concerns—fear, uncertainty, parental pressure, societal defaults—represent fixable mindsets rather than actual obstacles.

## My Takeaway

Most reasons not to start a startup aren't real reasons. They're excuses. Examine what's actually stopping you.
