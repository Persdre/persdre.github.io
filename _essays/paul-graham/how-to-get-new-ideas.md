# How to Get New Ideas

Paul Graham's essay [How to Get New Ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/getideas.html) presents a straightforward framework for generating novel ideas.

## The Core Principle

"Notice anomalies: what seems strange, or missing, or broken?"

While everyday observations reveal oddities, the richest source lies at the boundaries of human knowledge.

## The Fractal Model

Graham employs a fractal metaphor to explain knowledge expansion. From a distance, the edges of what we know appear smooth and complete.

However, upon closer examination—when you develop sufficient expertise in a field—those edges reveal themselves to be "full of gaps." These missing pieces appear so obvious that it becomes surprising no one has previously explored them.

## Opportunity in Gaps

The most promising ideas emerge from investigating these knowledge gaps. When pursued effectively, exploring these frontiers can generate "whole new fractal buds"—entirely new domains of knowledge and inquiry.

## My Takeaway

Breakthrough ideas aren't mysterious or inaccessible. They result from carefully observing what's absent or unexplained within specialized fields, then having the initiative to investigate those overlooked areas.

Get to the frontier of your field. Look for the gaps. Then explore them.
