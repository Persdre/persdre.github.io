# A Fundraising Survival Guide

Paul Graham's essay [A Fundraising Survival Guide](http://www.paulgraham.com/fundraising.html) argues that fundraising is the second-biggest threat to startups after failing to build something people want.

## Why It's Difficult

Markets are unforgiving, there are few potential investors, and investors behave unpredictably. The investor ecosystem creates instability through herd mentality—one investor's skepticism can trigger collective rejection.

## Nine Survival Strategies

1. **Manage Expectations**: Assume "deals fall through" consistently
2. **Keep Building**: Designate one founder for investors while others continue product development
3. **Be Conservative**: Accept reasonable offers when available
4. **Stay Flexible**: Avoid committing to fixed fundraising targets
5. **Pursue Independence**: Aim for "ramen profitable"
6. **Handle Rejection Analytically**: Don't internalize rejections
7. **Consider Consulting**: As a survival tactic only
8. **Avoid Inexperienced Investors**: They often create disproportionate work
9. **Track Investor Signals**: Focus energy on the most likely prospects

## My Takeaway

Fundraising is a distraction from building. Minimize the time spent on it, and never let it stop your product progress.
