# Six Principles for Making New Things

Paul Graham's essay [Six Principles for Making New Things](http://www.paulgraham.com/newthings.html) identifies a consistent design philosophy across Viaweb, Y Combinator, and his essays.

## The Six Principles

1. **Find simple solutions**: Elegance over complexity
2. **Target overlooked problems**: Work on issues others dismiss
3. **Solve real problems**: Actual user needs, not superficial features
4. **Deliver informally**: Substance over professional presentation
5. **Release crude version 1**: Start small and incomplete
6. **Iterate rapidly**: Learn through user feedback

## Why This Approach Generates Contempt

Simple solutions "don't seem as impressive as complex ones." Informal delivery requires audiences to understand content rather than judge presentation.

## Strategic Advantages

Working on overlooked problems reduces competition. Informal delivery saves resources. Crude initial releases benefit from "the imagination of nature."

## My Takeaway

"Ideas like that are all around you. But you ignore them because they look wrong." Trust your instincts on simple solutions.
