# Java's Cover

Paul Graham's essay [Java's Cover](http://www.paulgraham.com/javacover.html) examines why Java seemed suspicious to him, framing it as a study of "hacker's radar"—judging technology by external signs.

## The Core Thesis

"I'm not writing here about Java...but about hacker's radar." Certain warning signs suggest problems without direct experience.

## The Red Flags

**Marketing & Promotion**: Real standards like C and Unix don't require aggressive promotion.

**Design Philosophy**: Java was designed to be accessible to C programmers—mimicking mass-market products. Languages created for their makers (C, Lisp) succeed; those designed for general audiences (COBOL, Ada) fail.

**Ulterior Motives**: Java served Sun's strategic interest in competing with Microsoft.

**Lack of Passion**: "I've never heard anyone say that they loved Java."

**Forced Adoption**: Users adopted Java due to market pressure, not voluntary enthusiasm.

**Committee Design**: Quality languages emerge from small teams.

**Wrong Admirers**: Java appealed to non-technical executives rather than respected innovators.

## My Takeaway

When technology requires aggressive marketing and lacks passionate advocates, be suspicious. Great tools spread through word of mouth.
