# Hiring is Obsolete

Paul Graham's essay [Hiring is Obsolete](http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html) argues that decreased startup costs have fundamentally shifted power dynamics for talented young people.

## Changing Economics

The cost of launching a web-based company has plummeted. "The main cost of starting a Web-based startup is food and rent." This democratization means aspiring entrepreneurs no longer need investor permission or employer approval.

## Young Talent Undervaluation

Large organizations systematically undervalue capable twenty-somethings because they lack track records. "Some twenty-year-olds are more capable than all but a handful of 30 year olds," yet institutional hiring practices filter them out.

## Market Superiority Over Employers

Direct market feedback provides more accurate valuation than employers can offer. Users care only about product quality, not creator age—"On the Internet, nobody knows you're 22."

## Acquisition as Hiring

Large companies increasingly acquire startups as sophisticated hiring mechanisms, paying for proven teams rather than taking hiring risks.

## Risk-Reward Alignment

Young people optimally shoulder higher career risk since failure carries minimal consequences, while potential rewards far exceed traditional employment.

## My Takeaway

If you're young and talented, starting a company is increasingly the rational choice.
