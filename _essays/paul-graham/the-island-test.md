# The Island Test

Paul Graham's essay [The Island Test](http://www.paulgraham.com/island.html) proposes a practical diagnostic tool for understanding your true needs.

## The Test

Imagine spending a weekend on a remote Maine island with no shops and no exit. Whatever you'd pack beyond basics reveals your true addictions.

## What Graham Brings

1. **Books**: Partly distraction—"if the world gets boring I need to slip into another"
2. **Earplugs**: Essential for thinking; needs quiet for deep creative work
3. **Notebook and pen**: Professional tools that "wick ideas"

## Key Insights

**On Addiction**: The test reveals genuine dependencies versus casual preferences.

**On Thinking**: Different cognitive tasks require different conditions. Novel thinking demands complete silence.

**On Books as Distraction**: Graham acknowledges books function as escapism rather than serious reading.

**On Habit Change**: He recounts a mountain trek where he deliberately avoided books and found thinking equally rewarding.

## My Takeaway

Try the island test yourself. What would you actually bring? That reveals what you truly depend on.
