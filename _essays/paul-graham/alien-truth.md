# Alien Truth

Paul Graham's essay [Alien Truth](http://www.paulgraham.com/alien.html) proposes that certain truths would be shared by any intelligent beings in the universe—not just mathematical and physical laws.

## Shared Truths Beyond Math and Physics

The essay identifies principles likely universal to intelligent life:
- Controlled experiments validate hypotheses
- Practice improves skill
- Occam's razor applies

"There doesn't seem anything specifically human about any of these ideas."

## The Threshold Heuristic

Rather than speculating about alien life forms, the idea of alien truth serves as "a threshold, or more precisely a target, for truth."

It helps identify the most general truths we can discover by asking what intelligent beings elsewhere would necessarily understand.

## Philosophy Redefined

Graham suggests that philosophy—traditionally broad and diffuse—could be understood as the systematic search for alien truths. This gives the discipline clearer purpose and direction.

## Connection to Future AI

Future artificial intelligence might eventually help us identify precisely which truths any intelligent system must possess.

## My Takeaway

The attempt to discover alien truths represents worthwhile intellectual work, embodying its own principle—making it paradoxically an alien truth itself.
