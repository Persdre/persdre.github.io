# The Submarine

Paul Graham's essay [The Submarine](http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html) reveals how public relations firms operate as a massive, largely invisible force shaping news coverage.

## The Hidden Influence

"More than half" of non-political mainstream media stories originate from PR pitches rather than independent journalism.

## How PR Works

Graham's startup paid a PR firm $16,000 monthly. The best PR firms aren't dishonest—they provide genuinely valuable information while strategically emphasizing facts that benefit clients. Graham compares this to flattery: "tell his victim selective truths."

## The Suit Comeback Pattern

Multiple publications ran articles declaring suits were fashionable again across 2002-2005. By tracing shared sources and language, Graham discovered these stemmed from a coordinated PR campaign for The Men's Wearhouse.

## Why Media Differs

Trade publications heavily depend on PR because advertising funds them. Premium outlets maintain higher standards, though even major publications have vulnerable sections.

## The Digital Shift

Online writing feels more authentic because bloggers write from genuine interest. This authenticity explains why readers increasingly trust blogs over traditional publications.

## My Takeaway

Question what you read. Much of it is planted there for someone else's benefit.
