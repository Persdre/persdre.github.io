# Do Things That Don't Scale

Paul Graham's essay [Do Things that Don't Scale](http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html) is perhaps the most practically useful essay for early-stage founders. It demolishes the myth that great products naturally attract users.

## The Core Insight

Successful startups require founders to perform labor-intensive, non-scalable activities initially. You can't just build something and wait for users to come. You have to go get them—manually, one by one.

## Recruit Users Manually

Compound growth creates exponential returns. Acquiring just 10% more users weekly yields millions within two years. But that growth has to start somewhere.

Examples:
- **Stripe's "Collison installation"**: The founders would offer to set up Stripe for you right then and there, rather than just giving you a link
- **Airbnb**: Founders went door-to-door in New York with luggage, personally photographing listings and improving them

## Delight Your Customers

Provide exceptional service that seems impossible to scale. Wufoo sent handwritten thank-you notes to users. The goal is to create "insanely great" user experiences, not just products.

This isn't just a growth hack—it builds company culture permanently. How you treat your first users shapes how you'll treat all future users.

## Start Narrow

Focus on narrow segments to achieve critical mass quickly, then expand. Facebook started at Harvard only. This concentrated focus creates intensity that broad launches can't match.

## What Doesn't Work

Big launches and partnership deals rarely drive sustainable growth. Success depends on gradually building loyal users through attentiveness, not initial velocity.

## My Takeaway

Treat building a startup as a vector with two components: product innovation AND the unglamorous, labor-intensive work required to launch. The second part is often more important early on, yet it's the part most founders want to skip.
