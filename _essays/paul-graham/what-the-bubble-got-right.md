# What the Bubble Got Right

Paul Graham's essay [What the Bubble Got Right](http://www.paulgraham.com/bubble.html) identifies ten lasting trends that emerged during the Internet Bubble, despite the crash.

## The Ten Lasting Trends

1. **Retail VC**: Taking companies public early isn't inherently flawed
2. **The Internet**: The technology genuinely represents a major shift
3. **Choices**: The Internet removes bottlenecks controlling consumer access
4. **Youth**: Young founders can possess visionary thinking essential for CEOs
5. **Informality**: Casual dress signals that substance counts more than presentation
6. **Nerds**: Technical expertise becomes increasingly valuable
7. **Options**: Stock options effectively incentivize employees
8. **Startups**: Purpose-built startups create accountability faster than bureaucratic development
9. **California**: The Bay Area's progressive culture attracts entrepreneurial talent
10. **Productivity**: Technology multiplies productivity variations

## The Overarching Theme

**Good ideas increasingly matter more than connections or credentials.**

## My Takeaway

The bubble was wrong about valuations but right about the underlying trends. The revolution was real.
