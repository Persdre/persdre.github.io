# Undergraduation

Paul Graham's essay [Undergraduation](http://www.paulgraham.com/college.html) advises computer science undergraduates to prioritize becoming skilled hackers and learning about compelling problems.

## Hacking

The path to programming excellence involves:
1. Working extensively on challenging problems
2. Learning from accomplished programmers around you

Pursue personal projects rather than relying solely on coursework—they allow complete creative freedom.

## Mathematics

While most programming doesn't strictly require advanced math, study it for its conceptual value as a metaphor source for problem-solving.

## Choosing Academic Subjects

Prioritize departments with intellectual rigor: math, hard sciences, engineering, history, architecture, and classics. Be cautious about social sciences and philosophy.

## Practical Considerations

Open-source contributions and personal projects impress employers more than grades. Skill selection depends on career goals—big companies, startups, and entrepreneurship require different toolsets.

## Graduate School

While grad school offers intellectual community, the dissertation requirement is genuinely unpleasant. Success requires impressing professors through genuine intellectual interest.

## My Takeaway

"The only way forward is through doing what you love." Authenticity matters most.
