# Defining Property

Paul Graham's essay [Defining Property](http://www.paulgraham.com/property.html) argues that property definitions evolve based on practical utility rather than abstract principle.

## The Central Metaphor

A Japanese folktale: a judge rules against a shop owner claiming a student stole his cooking "smells." This illustrates that treating something as property only makes sense in certain conditions.

## Property is Contextual

"What counts as property depends on what works to treat as property. And that not only can change, but has changed." Hunter-gatherers didn't treat land as property like modern societies do.

## The Current Shift

Digital technology changed how information distributes. "Data moves like smells now"—abundant and difficult to control. Recording labels fight this shift through lawsuits and legislation.

## The Problem

"Crazy legal measures" distort society. This is evidence the property definition doesn't actually work.

## The Solution

Multiple sovereign countries and functioning democracies prevent monopolistic control. Societies must adapt gracefully rather than preserving obsolete frameworks.

## My Takeaway

Property definitions should match reality, not fight it.
