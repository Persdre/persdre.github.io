# After the Ladder

Paul Graham's essay [After the Ladder](http://www.paulgraham.com/ladder.html) contrasts the traditional corporate career path with the modern startup approach.

## The Old Model

"One was supposed to work one's way up the corporate ladder." Jobs offered security in exchange for loyalty—a guaranteed position functioning like an invisible annuity.

## Why the Ladder Collapsed

The 1980s merger-and-acquisition wave destroyed implicit corporate obligations. Companies didn't account for their commitments to employees expecting eventual promotions, making them attractive targets for raiders who could strip these hidden liabilities.

## The New Model

Today's approach favors building products independently and selling to larger companies. This has distinct advantages:

- Skilled engineers avoid being promoted into management roles they're unsuited for
- Less corporate politics
- More liquid and efficient outcomes

## The Trade-offs

Modern entrepreneurship carries greater risk from random factors. But was the old system truly safer? Projects got cancelled arbitrarily. Office politics determined outcomes.

## My Takeaway

The corporate ladder is gone and won't return. Building something valuable yourself is now the primary path to career success.
