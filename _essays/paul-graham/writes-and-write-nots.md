# Writes and Write-Nots

Paul Graham's essay [Writes and Write-Nots](http://www.paulgraham.com/writes.html) predicts that within decades, the ability to write will become a rare skill, dividing society into those who can write and those who cannot.

## Writing is Inherently Difficult

Writing requires clear thinking, which is fundamentally challenging. This difficulty has historically forced most professionals to develop writing skills.

## AI Changes Everything

Artificial intelligence now provides an escape from the pressure to write. People can use AI to generate written content in both academic and professional settings, removing the necessity to learn writing.

## The Disappearing Middle

Rather than a spectrum of writing ability, society will polarize into skilled writers and those with no writing ability. The middle ground of adequate writers will vanish.

## Writing Equals Thinking

"If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking." Writing is not merely a communication tool—it's a thinking tool itself.

## A Troubling Precedent

Just as most people no longer need physical strength due to technology, writing will become optional. Only those who actively pursue it will develop the skill—and the critical thinking that accompanies it.

## My Takeaway

A world without widespread writing ability is dangerous because it becomes a world without widespread rigorous thinking.
