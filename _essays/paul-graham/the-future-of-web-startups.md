# The Future of Web Startups

Paul Graham's essay [The Future of Web Startups](http://www.paulgraham.com/webstartups.html) predicts how cheap web startups will transform the ecosystem.

## Ten Key Predictions

1. **Lots of Startups**: The barrier shifts from capital to courage
2. **Standardization**: "When technology makes something dramatically cheaper, standardization always follows"
3. **New Attitude to Acquisition**: Large companies treat acquisitions like hiring
4. **Riskier Strategies Become Possible**: Portfolio-thinking replaces risk aversion
5. **Younger, Nerdier Founders**: Demonstrate working products, not polished pitches
6. **Startup Hubs Persist**: Geography matters less for starting but more for succeeding
7. **Better Judgment Required**: Investors must evaluate thousands of applications
8. **College Will Change**: Users judge performance directly
9. **Lots of Competitors**: Easy entry encourages faster implementation
10. **Faster Advances**: Startups replace large companies as innovation centers

## The Metaphor

The startup ecosystem is upgrading from "narrow, twisty pipes" to "a single, huge pipe" where performance metrics propagate directly.

## My Takeaway

As startups become cheaper, more people will attempt entrepreneurship. Competition doesn't create zero-sum conditions—it accelerates everything.
