# Inequality and Risk

Paul Graham's essay [Inequality and Risk](http://www.paulgraham.com/inequality.html) argues that reducing economic inequality necessarily suppresses entrepreneurial risk-taking.

## The Core Connection

"Risk and reward have to be proportionate."

Lowering maximum potential rewards decreases willingness to take risks. Policies targeting inequality reduction directly undermine financial incentives driving startup creation.

## Why Startups Matter

Startups are intrinsically risky—approximately 1 in 10 succeed. They generate disproportionate technological innovation and job creation.

Founders pursue startups primarily to achieve financial security, not luxury consumption. Without substantial wealth prospects, ambitious individuals would seek stable positions instead.

## The Irreplaceability Problem

While venture capital could theoretically come from government, bureaucrats naturally avoid risk and favor "safe" choices. More critically, founders cannot be replaced—they contribute irreplaceable ideas and time.

## A Better Alternative

Rather than attacking wealth directly, target corruption instead. The real problem is wealth translating into political power. Advocate for "transparency" to sever the wealth-power connection while preserving entrepreneurial incentives.

## My Takeaway

Suppressing inequality means accepting slower technological development.
