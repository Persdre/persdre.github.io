# Why I Write in Public

I've largely stopped doing one-on-one conversations. Not because I don't care about people—but because I've realized that most of these conversations don't scale.

## The Problem with One-on-One

Every week, I receive requests for coffee chats, career advice calls, and "quick questions" that turn into hour-long discussions. Each conversation feels valuable in the moment. But when I step back, I see the pattern: I'm answering the same questions repeatedly, sharing the same insights, giving the same advice—to one person at a time.

This is a terrible use of time. Not just mine, but theirs too. They wait days or weeks for a 30-minute slot, when the same insights could be available immediately.

## When I Still Do It

I haven't eliminated one-on-one conversations entirely. Sometimes they're necessary for effective collaboration, or for building relationships that genuinely matter. When I do have these conversations now, I think of them as charity—my small contribution to the community. A gift of time, not an obligation.

This framing helps. Charity is something you give freely, without resentment, without expecting return. It's bounded and intentional.

## The Alternative: Writing in Public

Instead of repeating myself in private, I now put my thoughts where everyone can access them—on this website, on social media, in public writing.

This approach has several advantages:

**Scale.** One article can help thousands. One conversation helps one person.

**Permanence.** Ideas written down can be referenced, shared, and built upon. Spoken words disappear.

**Clarity.** Writing forces me to think more carefully. The process of articulating ideas sharpens them.

**Accessibility.** Anyone can read at any time. No scheduling, no waiting, no gatekeeping.

## Context in the AI Age

Here's what makes this particularly relevant now: in an age of AI, authentic human context becomes irreplaceable.

AI can summarize, synthesize, and generate. But it cannot produce genuine human experience, personal judgment, or hard-won insights from actual work. When I write about my real experiences—what I've tried, what failed, what I believe and why—I'm creating something AI cannot replicate.

This is the new value proposition of personal writing. Not information (AI has that covered), but authentic human perspective.

## The Invitation

So if you were hoping to schedule a call with me, consider this: whatever question you have, I'm probably going to write about it eventually. And when I do, that writing will be available to you and everyone else who shares that question.

In the meantime, feel free to email me interesting ideas. I read everything. I just don't promise to respond to everything—but your question might become my next article.
