# Strategy Letter V: Commoditizing Your Complements

Joel Spolsky's [Strategy Letter V](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/06/12/strategy-letter-v/) explains a powerful business strategy: "Demand for a product increases when the prices of its complements decrease."

## The Core Strategy

Smart companies try to commoditize their products' complements—making supplementary products cheap, interchangeable, and undifferentiated so more people purchase the main product.

## Real-World Examples

**IBM and PCs**: IBM documented PC interfaces to encourage manufacturers to create cheap add-in cards and peripherals. Lower-cost components drove PC sales.

**Microsoft**: By licensing DOS to multiple PC manufacturers rather than exclusively to IBM, Microsoft made PCs commodities. Cheaper hardware increased demand for operating systems—their actual profit center.

**Enterprise Software**: IBM supports open-source software because consulting (their complement) benefits when enterprise software becomes commoditized.

**Sun and Java**: Sun promoted bytecode architecture to make hardware interchangeable, expanding software demand—though this paradoxically hurt Sun since they were primarily a hardware company.

## Key Insight

Hardware easily commoditizes software (through abstraction layers), but software rarely commoditizes hardware. This asymmetry shapes strategic decisions across the technology industry.

## My Takeaway

Understanding this principle reveals the hidden logic behind many tech company decisions that seem irrational on the surface. As a founder, identify your complements and consider how commoditizing them could grow your core business.
