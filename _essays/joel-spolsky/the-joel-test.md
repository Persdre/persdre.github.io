# The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code

Joel Spolsky's article [The Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/) presents a quick assessment tool for evaluating software team quality through 12 yes/no questions.

## The 12 Questions

1. **Do you use source control?** - Essential for team coordination and preventing code loss
2. **Can you make a build in one step?** - Automated compilation reduces errors during shipping
3. **Do you make daily builds?** - Catches integration problems immediately
4. **Do you have a bug database?** - Formal tracking prevents bugs from being forgotten
5. **Do you fix bugs before writing new code?** - Prioritize fixes over features to maintain schedules
6. **Do you have an up-to-date schedule?** - Enables business planning and prevents feature creep
7. **Do you have a spec?** - Design problems are cheaper to fix in documents than code
8. **Do programmers have quiet working conditions?** - Uninterrupted focus enables productive "flow" states
9. **Do you use the best tools money can buy?** - Quality equipment prevents frustration
10. **Do you have testers?** - More cost-effective than having programmers test their own work
11. **Do new candidates write code during their interview?** - Actual coding demonstrates capabilities
12. **Do you do hallway usability testing?** - Five users reveal 95% of UI problems

## Scoring

A score of 12 is perfect; 11 is acceptable. Below 10 indicates serious problems. Most organizations score around 2-3.

## My Takeaway

This test remains remarkably relevant decades later. As a builder, these fundamentals separate amateur operations from professional ones. The beauty is its simplicity—you can evaluate any team in minutes.
